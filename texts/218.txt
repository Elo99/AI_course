Generating natural and informative texts has been a long-standing problem in
NLP. Much effort has been dedicated into incorporating pre-trained language
models (PLMs) with various open-world knowledge, such as knowledge graphs or
wiki pages. However, their ability to access and manipulate the task-specific
knowledge is still limited on downstream tasks, as this type of knowledge is
usually not well covered in PLMs and is hard to acquire. To address the
problem, we propose augmenting TExt Generation via Task-specific and Open-world
Knowledge (TegTok) in a unified framework. Our model selects knowledge entries
from two types of knowledge sources through dense retrieval and then injects
them into the input encoding and output decoding stages respectively on the
basis of PLMs. With the help of these two types of knowledge, our model can
learn what and how to generate. Experiments on two text generation tasks of
dialogue generation and question generation, and on two datasets show that our
method achieves better performance than various baseline models.
