We prove that the augmentation variety of any positive braid Legendrian link
carries a natural cluster $\mathrm{K}_2$ structure. We present an algorithm to
calculate the cluster seeds that correspond to the admissible Lagrangian
fillings of the positive braid Legendrian links. Utilizing augmentations and
cluster algebras, we develop a new framework to distinguish exact Lagrangian
fillings.
