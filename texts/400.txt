Previous research has proposed a machine speech chain to enable automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) to assist each
other in semi-supervised learning and to avoid the need for a large amount of
paired speech and text data. However, that framework still requires a large
amount of unpaired (speech or text) data. A prototype multimodal machine chain
was then explored to further reduce the need for a large amount of unpaired
data, which could improve ASR or TTS even when no more speech or text data were
available. Unfortunately, this framework relied on the image retrieval (IR)
model, and thus it was limited to handling only those images that were already
known during training. Furthermore, the performance of this framework was only
investigated with single-speaker artificial speech data. In this study, we
revamp the multimodal machine chain framework with image generation (IG) and
investigate the possibility of augmenting image data for ASR and TTS using
single-loop and dual-loop architectures on multispeaker natural speech data.
Experimental results revealed that both single-loop and dual-loop multimodal
chain frameworks enabled ASR and TTS to improve their performance using an
image-only dataset.
