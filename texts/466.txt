Static and dynamic hand movements are basic way for human-machine
interactions. To recognize and classify these movements, first these movements
are captured by the cameras mounted on the augmented reality (AR) or virtual
reality (VR) wearable devices. The hand is segmented using segmentation method
and its gestures are passed to hand gesture recognition algorithm, which
depends on depth-wise separable convolutional neural network for training,
testing and finally running smoothly on mobile AR/VR devices, while maintaining
the accuracy and balancing the load. A number of gestures are processed for
identification of right gesture and to classify the gesture and ignore the all
intermittent gestures. With proposed method, a user can write letters and
numbers in air by just moving his/her hand in air. Gesture based operations are
performed, and trajectory of hand is recorded as handwritten text. Finally,
that handwritten text is processed for the text recognition.
