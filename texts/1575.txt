Here we present 1584 new southern proper motion systems with mu > 0.18 "/yr
and 16.5 > R_59F > 18.0. This search complements the six previous
SuperCOSMOS-RECONS (SCR) proper motion searches of the southern sky for stars
within the same proper motion range, but with R_59F < 16.5. As in previous
papers, we present distance estimates for these systems and find that three
systems are estimated to be within 25 pc, including one, SCR 1546-5534,
possibly within the RECONS 10 pc horizon at 6.7 pc, making it the second
nearest discovery of the searches. We find 97 white dwarf candidates with
distance estimates between 10 and 120 pc, as well as 557 cool subdwarf
candidates. The subdwarfs found in this paper make up nearly half of the
subdwarf systems reported from our SCR searches, and are significantly redder
than those discovered thus far. The SCR searches have now found 155 red dwarfs
estimated to be within 25 pc, including 10 within 10 pc. In addition, 143 white
dwarf candidates and 1155 cool subdwarf candidates have been discovered. The
1584 systems reported here augment the sample of 4724 systems previously
discovered in our SCR searches, and imply that additional systems fainter than
R_59F = 18.0 are yet to be discovered.
