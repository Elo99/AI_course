Image augmentations are quintessential for effective visual representation
learning across self-supervised learning techniques. While augmentation
strategies for natural imaging have been studied extensively, medical images
are vastly different from their natural counterparts. Thus, it is unknown
whether common augmentation strategies employed in Siamese representation
learning generalize to medical images and to what extent. To address this
challenge, in this study, we systematically assess the effect of various
augmentations on the quality and robustness of the learned representations. We
train and evaluate Siamese Networks for abnormality detection on chest X-Rays
across three large datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert and VinDR-CXR). We investigate
the efficacy of the learned representations through experiments involving
linear probing, fine-tuning, zero-shot transfer, and data efficiency. Finally,
we identify a set of augmentations that yield robust representations that
generalize well to both out-of-distribution data and diseases, while
outperforming supervised baselines using just zero-shot transfer and linear
probes by up to 20%.
