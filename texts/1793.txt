The application of deep learning to build accurate predictive models from
functional neuroimaging data is often hindered by limited dataset sizes. Though
data augmentation can help mitigate such training obstacles, most data
augmentation methods have been developed for natural images as in computer
vision tasks such as CIFAR, not for medical images. This work helps to fills in
this gap by proposing a method for generating new functional Magnetic Resonance
Images (fMRI) with realistic brain morphology. This method is tested on a
challenging task of predicting antidepressant treatment response from
pre-treatment task-based fMRI and demonstrates a 26% improvement in performance
in predicting response using augmented images. This improvement compares
favorably to state-of-the-art augmentation methods for natural images. Through
an ablative test, augmentation is also shown to substantively improve
performance when applied before hyperparameter optimization. These results
suggest the optimal order of operations and support the role of data
augmentation method for improving predictive performance in tasks using fMRI.
