I give a very brief review of aspects of internal dynamics that affect the
global shape of a galaxy, focusing on triaxiality, bars and warps. There is
general agreement that large central masses can destroy triaxial shapes, but
recent simulations of this process seem to suffer from numerical difficulties.
Central black holes alone are probably not massive enough to destroy global
triaxiality, but when augmented by star and gas concentrations in barred
galaxies, the global shape may be affected. Even though we do not understand
the origin of bars in galaxies, they are very useful as probes of the dark
matter density of the inner halo. Finally, I note that dynamical friction acts
to reduce a misalignment between the spin axes of the disk and halo, producing
a nice warp in the outer disk which has many of the properties of observed
galactic warps.
