Text augmentation techniques are widely used in text classification problems
to improve the performance of classifiers, especially in low-resource
scenarios. Whilst lots of creative text augmentation methods have been
designed, they augment the text in a non-selective manner, which means the less
important or noisy words have the same chances to be augmented as the
informative words, and thereby limits the performance of augmentation. In this
work, we systematically summarize three kinds of role keywords, which have
different functions for text classification, and design effective methods to
extract them from the text. Based on these extracted role keywords, we propose
STA (Selective Text Augmentation) to selectively augment the text, where the
informative, class-indicating words are emphasized but the irrelevant or noisy
words are diminished. Extensive experiments on four English and Chinese text
classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that STA can substantially
outperform the non-selective text augmentation methods.
