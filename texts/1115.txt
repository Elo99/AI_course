We propose a block Krylov subspace version of the GCRO-DR method proposed in
[Parks et al. SISC 2005], which is an iterative method allowing for the
efficient minimization of the the residual over an augmented block Krylov
subspace. We offer a clean derivation of the method and discuss methods of
selecting recycling subspaces at restart as well as implementation decisions in
the context of high-performance computing. Numerical experiments are split into
those demonstrating convergence properties and those demonstrating the data
movement and cache efficiencies of the dominant operations of the method,
measured using processor monitoring code from Intel.
