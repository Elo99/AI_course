Interest in automatic people re-identification systems has significantly
grown in recent years, mainly for developing surveillance and smart shops
software. Due to the variability in person posture, different lighting
conditions, and occluded scenarios, together with the poor quality of the
images obtained by different cameras, it is currently an unsolved problem. In
machine learning-based computer vision applications with reduced data sets, one
possibility to improve the performance of re-identification system is through
the augmentation of the set of images or videos available for training the
neural models. Currently, one of the most robust ways to generate synthetic
information for data augmentation, whether it is video, images or text, are the
generative adversarial networks. This article reviews the most relevant recent
approaches to improve the performance of person re-identification models
through data augmentation, using generative adversarial networks. We focus on
three categories of data augmentation approaches: style transfer, pose
transfer, and random generation.
