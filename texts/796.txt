Computing similarity between two legal case documents is an important and
challenging task in Legal IR, for which text-based and network-based measures
have been proposed in literature. All prior network-based similarity methods
considered a precedent citation network among case documents only (PCNet).
However, this approach misses an important source of legal knowledge -- the
hierarchy of legal statutes that are applicable in a given legal jurisdiction
(e.g., country). We propose to augment the PCNet with the hierarchy of legal
statutes, to form a heterogeneous network Hier-SPCNet, having citation links
between case documents and statutes, as well as citation and hierarchy links
among the statutes. Experiments over a set of Indian Supreme Court case
documents show that our proposed heterogeneous network enables significantly
better document similarity estimation, as compared to existing approaches using
PCNet. We also show that the proposed network-based method can complement
text-based measures for better estimation of legal document similarity.
