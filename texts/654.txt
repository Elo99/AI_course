Image captioning models aim at connecting Vision and Language by providing
natural language descriptions of input images. In the past few years, the task
has been tackled by learning parametric models and proposing visual feature
extraction advancements or by modeling better multi-modal connections. In this
paper, we investigate the development of an image captioning approach with a
kNN memory, with which knowledge can be retrieved from an external corpus to
aid the generation process. Our architecture combines a knowledge retriever
based on visual similarities, a differentiable encoder, and a kNN-augmented
attention layer to predict tokens based on the past context and on text
retrieved from the external memory. Experimental results, conducted on the COCO
dataset, demonstrate that employing an explicit external memory can aid the
generation process and increase caption quality. Our work opens up new avenues
for improving image captioning models at larger scale.
