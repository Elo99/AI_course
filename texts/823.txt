Transliteration is very common on social media, but transliterated text is
not adequately handled by modern neural models for various NLP tasks. In this
work, we combine data augmentation approaches with a Teacher-Student training
scheme to address this issue in a cross-lingual transfer setting for
fine-tuning state-of-the-art pre-trained multilingual language models such as
mBERT and XLM-R. We evaluate our method on transliterated Hindi and Malayalam,
also introducing new datasets for benchmarking on real-world scenarios: one on
sentiment classification in transliterated Malayalam, and another on crisis
tweet classification in transliterated Hindi and Malayalam (related to the 2013
North India and 2018 Kerala floods). Our method yielded an average improvement
of +5.6% on mBERT and +4.7% on XLM-R in F1 scores over their strong baselines.
