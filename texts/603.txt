This paper presents an augmented state observer design for the simultaneous
estimation of charge state and crossover flux in disproportionation redox flow
batteries, which exhibits exponential estimation error convergence to a bounded
residual set. The crossover flux of vanadium through the porous separator is
considered as an unknown function of the battery states, model-approximated as
the output of a persistently excited linear system. This parametric model and
the simple isothermal lumped parameter model of the battery are combined to
form an augmented space state representation suitable for the observer design,
which is carried out via Lyapunov stability theory including the
error-uncertainty involved in the approximation of the crossover flux. The
observer gain is calculated by solving a polytopic linear matrix inequality
problem via convex optimization. The performance of this design is evaluated
with a laboratory flow battery prototype undergoing self-discharge.
