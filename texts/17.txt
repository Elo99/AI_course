We introduce AugLy, a data augmentation library with a focus on adversarial
robustness. AugLy provides a wide array of augmentations for multiple
modalities (audio, image, text, & video). These augmentations were inspired by
those that real users perform on social media platforms, some of which were not
already supported by existing data augmentation libraries. AugLy can be used
for any purpose where data augmentations are useful, but it is particularly
well-suited for evaluating robustness and systematically generating adversarial
attacks. In this paper we present how AugLy works, benchmark it compared
against existing libraries, and use it to evaluate the robustness of various
state-of-the-art models to showcase AugLy's utility. The AugLy repository can
be found at https://github.com/facebookresearch/AugLy.
