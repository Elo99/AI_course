This paper describes the system submitted to the IWSLT 2021 Multilingual
Speech Translation (MultiST) task from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. We use a unified
transformer architecture for our MultiST model, so that the data from different
modalities (i.e., speech and text) and different tasks (i.e., Speech
Recognition, Machine Translation, and Speech Translation) can be exploited to
enhance the model's ability. Specifically, speech and text inputs are firstly
fed to different feature extractors to extract acoustic and textual features,
respectively. Then, these features are processed by a shared encoder--decoder
architecture. We apply several training techniques to improve the performance,
including multi-task learning, task-level curriculum learning, data
augmentation, etc. Our final system achieves significantly better results than
bilingual baselines on supervised language pairs and yields reasonable results
on zero-shot language pairs.
