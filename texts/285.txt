Coreference resolution is an important component in analyzing narrative text
from administrative data (e.g., clinical or police sources). However, existing
coreference models trained on general language corpora suffer from poor
transferability due to domain gaps, especially when they are applied to
gender-inclusive data with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
individuals. In this paper, we analyzed the challenges of coreference
resolution in an exemplary form of administrative text written in English:
violent death narratives from the USA's Centers for Disease Control's (CDC)
National Violent Death Reporting System. We developed a set of data
augmentation rules to improve model performance using a probabilistic data
programming framework. Experiments on narratives from an administrative
database, as well as existing gender-inclusive coreference datasets,
demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation in training coreference
models that can better handle text data about LGBT individuals.
