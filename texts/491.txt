Despite the recent impressive breakthroughs in text-to-image generation,
generative models have difficulty in capturing the data distribution of
underrepresented attribute compositions while over-memorizing overrepresented
attribute compositions, which raises public concerns about their robustness and
fairness. To tackle this challenge, we propose ACTIG, an attribute-centric
compositional text-to-image generation framework. We present an
attribute-centric feature augmentation and a novel image-free training scheme,
which greatly improves model's ability to generate images with underrepresented
attributes. We further propose an attribute-centric contrastive loss to avoid
overfitting to overrepresented attribute compositions. We validate our
framework on the CelebA-HQ and CUB datasets. Extensive experiments show that
the compositional generalization of ACTIG is outstanding, and our framework
outperforms previous works in terms of image quality and text-image
consistency.
