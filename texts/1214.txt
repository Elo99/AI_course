This paper describes our approach to the task of identifying offensive
languages in a multilingual setting. We investigate two data augmentation
strategies: using additional semi-supervised labels with different thresholds
and cross-lingual transfer with data selection. Leveraging the semi-supervised
dataset resulted in performance improvements compared to the baseline trained
solely with the manually-annotated dataset. We propose a new metric,
Translation Embedding Distance, to measure the transferability of instances for
cross-lingual data selection. We also introduce various preprocessing steps
tailored for social media text along with methods to fine-tune the pre-trained
multilingual BERT (mBERT) for offensive language identification. Our
multilingual systems achieved competitive results in Greek, Danish, and Turkish
at OffensEval 2020.
