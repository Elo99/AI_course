In this paper we analyze symmetries, hidden symmetries, and commensurability
classes of $(\epsilon, d_L)$-twisted knot complements, which are the
complements of knots that have a sufficiently large number of twists in each of
their twist regions. These knot complements can be constructed via long Dehn
fillings on fully augmented links complements. We show that such knot
complements have no hidden symmetries, which implies that there are at most two
other knot complements in their respective commensurability classes. Under mild
additional hypotheses, we show that these knots have at most four
(orientation-preserving) symmetries and are the only knot complements in their
respective commensurability classes. Finally, we provide an infinite family of
explicit examples of $(\epsilon, d_L)$-twisted knot complements that are the
unique knot complements in their respective commensurability classes obtained
by filling a fully augmented link with four crossing circles.
