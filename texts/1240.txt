We review the attempt to construct massless gauge field theories in Minkowski
spacetime that go under the name of HS-YM. We present their actions and their
symmetries. We motivate their gravitational interpretation. In particular we
show how to recover the local Lorentz invariance, which is absent in the
original formulation of the theories. Then we propose a perturbative
quantization in the so-called frozen momentum frame. We discuss physical and
unphysical modes and show how to deal with them. Finally we uncover the gauge
symmetry hidden under such unphysical modes. This requires a nonlocal
reformulation of the theory, which is, however, characterized by an augmented
degree of symmetry.
