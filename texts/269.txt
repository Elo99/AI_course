Recently introduced Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) bridges
images and text by embedding them into a joint latent space. This opens the
door to ample literature that aims to manipulate an input image by providing a
textual explanation. However, due to the discrepancy between image and text
embeddings in the joint space, using text embeddings as the optimization target
often introduces undesired artifacts in the resulting images. Disentanglement,
interpretability, and controllability are also hard to guarantee for
manipulation. To alleviate these problems, we propose to define corpus
subspaces spanned by relevant prompts to capture specific image
characteristics. We introduce CLIP Projection-Augmentation Embedding (PAE) as
an optimization target to improve the performance of text-guided image
manipulation. Our method is a simple and general paradigm that can be easily
computed and adapted, and smoothly incorporated into any CLIP-based image
manipulation algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we
conduct several theoretical and empirical studies. As a case study, we utilize
the method for text-guided semantic face editing. We quantitatively and
qualitatively demonstrate that PAE facilitates a more disentangled,
interpretable, and controllable image manipulation with state-of-the-art
quality and accuracy.
