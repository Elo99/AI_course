This paper presents a far-field text-dependent speaker verification database
named HI-MIA. We aim to meet the data requirement for far-field microphone
array based speaker verification since most of the publicly available databases
are single channel close-talking and text-independent. The database contains
recordings of 340 people in rooms designed for the far-field scenario.
Recordings are captured by multiple microphone arrays located in different
directions and distance to the speaker and a high-fidelity close-talking
microphone. Besides, we propose a set of end-to-end neural network based
baseline systems that adopt single-channel data for training. Moreover, we
propose a testing background aware enrollment augmentation strategy to further
enhance the performance. Results show that the fusion systems could achieve
3.29% EER in the far-field enrollment far field testing task and 4.02% EER in
the close-talking enrollment and far-field testing task.
