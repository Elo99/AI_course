People suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers seek
different approaches to cope with memory loss. Although AD patients want to
live independently, they often need help from caregivers. In this situation,
caregivers may attach notes on every single object or take out the contents of
a drawer to make them visible before leaving the patient alone at home. This
study reports preliminary results on an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) real-time
system, achieved through the Internet of Things (IoT) and Augmented Reality
(AR) concepts, aimed at helping people suffering from AD. The system has two
main sections: the smartphone or windows application allows caregivers to
monitor patients' status at home and be notified if patients are at risk. The
second part allows patients to use smart glasses to recognize QR codes in the
environment and receive information related to tags in the form of audio, text,
or three-dimensional image. This work presents preliminary results and
investigates the possibility of implementing such a system.
