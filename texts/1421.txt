We introduce augmented biracks and define a (co)homology theory associated to
augmented biracks. The new homology theory extends the previously studied
Yang-Baxter homology with a combinatorial formulation for the boundary map and
specializes to $N$-reduced rack homology when the birack is a rack. We
introduce augmented birack 2-cocycle invariants of classical and virtual knots
and links and provide examples.
