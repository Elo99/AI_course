This paper describes the NPU system submitted to Interspeech 2020 Far-Field
Speaker Verification Challenge (FFSVC). We particularly focus on far-field
text-dependent SV from single (task1) and multiple microphone arrays (task3).
The major challenges in such scenarios are short utterance and cross-channel
and distance mismatch for enrollment and test. With the belief that better
speaker embedding can alleviate the effects from short utterance, we introduce
a new speaker embedding architecture - ResNet-BAM, which integrates a
bottleneck attention module with ResNet as a simple and efficient way to
further improve the representation power of ResNet. This contribution brings up
to 1% EER reduction. We further address the mismatch problem in three
directions. First, domain adversarial training, which aims to learn
domain-invariant features, can yield to 0.8% EER reduction. Second, front-end
signal processing, including WPE and beamforming, has no obvious contribution,
but together with data selection and domain adversarial training, can further
contribute to 0.5% EER reduction. Finally, data augmentation, which works with
a specifically-designed data selection strategy, can lead to 2% EER reduction.
Together with the above contributions, in the middle challenge results, our
single submission system (without multi-system fusion) achieves the first and
second place on task 1 and task 3, respectively.
