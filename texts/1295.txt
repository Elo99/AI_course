Let $X$ be a normal projective variety with only klt singularities, and $L_X$
a strictly nef $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor on $X$. In this paper, we study the
singular version of Serrano's conjecture, i.e., the ampleness of $K_X+t L_X$
for sufficiently large $t\gg 1$. We show that, if $X$ is assumed to be a
$\mathbb{Q}$-factorial Gorenstein terminal threefold, then $K_X+tL_X$ is ample
for $t\gg 1$ unless $X$ is a weak Calabi-Yau variety (i.e., the canonical
divisor $K_X\sim_\mathbb{Q}0$ and the augmented irregularity $q^\circ(X)=0$)
with $L_X\cdot c_2(X)=0$.
