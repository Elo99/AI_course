Online social networks are ubiquitous and user-friendly. Nevertheless, it is
vital to detect and moderate offensive content to maintain decency and empathy.
However, mining social media texts is a complex task since users don't adhere
to any fixed patterns. Comments can be written in any combination of languages
and many of them may be low-resource.
  In this paper, we present our system for the LT-EDI shared task on detecting
homophobia and transphobia in social media comments. We experiment with a
number of monolingual and multilingual transformer based models such as mBERT
along with a data augmentation technique for tackling class imbalance. Such
pretrained large models have recently shown tremendous success on a variety of
benchmark tasks in natural language processing. We observe their performance on
a carefully annotated, real life dataset of YouTube comments in English as well
as Tamil.
  Our submission achieved ranks 9, 6 and 3 with a macro-averaged F1-score of
0.42, 0.64 and 0.58 in the English, Tamil and Tamil-English subtasks
respectively. The code for the system has been open sourced.
