We take advantage of the principal bundle geometry of the space of
connections to obtain general results on the presymplectic structure of two
classes of (pure) gauge theories: invariant theories, and non-invariant
theories satisfying two restricting hypothesis. In particular, we derive the
general field-dependent gauge transformations of the presymplectic potential
and presymplectic 2-form in both cases. We point-out that a generalisation of
the standard bundle geometry, called twisted geometry, arises naturally in the
study of non-invariant gauge theories (e.g. non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory).
These results prove that the well-known problem of associating a symplectic
structure to a gauge theory over bounded regions is a generic feature of both
classes. The edge modes strategy, recently introduced to address this issue,
has been actively developed in various contexts by several authors. We draw
attention to the dressing field method as the geometric framework underpinning,
or rather encompassing, this strategy. The geometric insight afforded by the
method both clarifies it and clearly delineates its potential shortcomings as
well as its conditions of success. Applying our general framework to various
examples allows to straightforwardly recover several results of the recent
literature on edge modes and on the presymplectic structure of general
relativity.
