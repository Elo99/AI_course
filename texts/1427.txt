Data augmentation is an effective and universal technique for improving
generalization performance of deep neural networks. It could enrich diversity
of training samples that is essential in medical image segmentation tasks
because 1) the scale of medical image dataset is typically smaller, which may
increase the risk of overfitting; 2) the shape and modality of different
objects such as organs or tumors are unique, thus requiring customized data
augmentation policy. However, most data augmentation implementations are
hand-crafted and suboptimal in medical image processing. To fully exploit the
potential of data augmentation, we propose an efficient algorithm to
automatically search for the optimal augmentation strategies. We formulate the
coupled optimization w.r.t. network weights and augmentation parameters into a
differentiable form by means of stochastic relaxation. This formulation allows
us to apply alternative gradient-based methods to solve it, i.e. stochastic
natural gradient method with adaptive step-size. To the best of our knowledge,
it is the first time that differentiable automatic data augmentation is
employed in medical image segmentation tasks. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing
build-in data augmentation of state-of-the-art models.
