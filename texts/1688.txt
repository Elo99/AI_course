Polyphonic sound event localization and detection (SELD) has many practical
applications in acoustic sensing and monitoring. However, the development of
real-time SELD has been limited by the demanding computational requirement of
most recent SELD systems. In this work, we introduce SALSA-Lite, a fast and
effective feature for polyphonic SELD using microphone array inputs. SALSA-Lite
is a lightweight variation of a previously proposed SALSA feature for
polyphonic SELD. SALSA, which stands for Spatial Cue-Augmented Log-Spectrogram,
consists of multichannel log-spectrograms stacked channelwise with the
normalized principal eigenvectors of the spectrotemporally corresponding
spatial covariance matrices. In contrast to SALSA, which uses eigenvector-based
spatial features, SALSA-Lite uses normalized inter-channel phase differences as
spatial features, allowing a 30-fold speedup compared to the original SALSA
feature. Experimental results on the TAU-NIGENS Spatial Sound Events 2021
dataset showed that the SALSA-Lite feature achieved competitive performance
compared to the full SALSA feature, and significantly outperformed the
traditional feature set of multichannel log-mel spectrograms with generalized
cross-correlation spectra. Specifically, using SALSA-Lite features increased
localization-dependent F1 score and class-dependent localization recall by 15%
and 5%, respectively, compared to using multichannel log-mel spectrograms with
generalized cross-correlation spectra.
