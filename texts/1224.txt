The present work introduces new scalar and fermionic degrees of freedom to
the Standard Model. While the scalar sector is augmented by a complex scalar
triplet and a doubly charged scalar singlet, the fermionic sector is extended
by two copies of vector-like leptons. Of these, one copy is an $SU(2)_L$
singlet while the other, an $SU(2)_L$ doublet. We explain how this combination
can offer a solution to the muon g-2 anomaly and also lead to non-zero neutrino
masses. In addition, it is also shown that the parameter regions compliant with
the two aforementioned issues can stabilise the electroweak vacuum till the
Planck scale, something not possible within the Standard Model alone.
