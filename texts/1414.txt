Prior work has demonstrated that data augmentation is useful for improving
dialogue state tracking. However, there are many types of user utterances,
while the prior method only considered the simplest one for augmentation,
raising the concern about poor generalization capability. In order to better
cover diverse dialogue acts and control the generation quality, this paper
proposes controllable user dialogue act augmentation (CUDA-DST) to augment user
utterances with diverse behaviors. With the augmented data, different state
trackers gain improvement and show better robustness, achieving the
state-of-the-art performance on MultiWOZ 2.1
