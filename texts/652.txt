This paper studies multi-task training of retrieval-augmented generation
models for knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose to clean the training set by
utilizing a distinct property of knowledge-intensive generation: The connection
of query-answer pairs to items in the knowledge base. We filter training
examples via a threshold of confidence on the relevance labels, whether a pair
is answerable by the knowledge base or not. We train a single Fusion-in-Decoder
(FiD) generator on seven combined tasks of the KILT benchmark. The experimental
results suggest that our simple yet effective approach substantially improves
competitive baselines on two strongly imbalanced tasks; and shows either
smaller improvements or no significant regression on the remaining tasks.
Furthermore, we demonstrate our multi-task training with relevance label
sampling scales well with increased model capacity and achieves
state-of-the-art results in five out of seven KILT tasks.
