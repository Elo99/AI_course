We study the effect of different approaches to text augmentation. To do this
we use 3 datasets that include social media and formal text in the form of news
articles. Our goal is to provide insights for practitioners and researchers on
making choices for augmentation for classification use cases. We observe that
Word2vec-based augmentation is a viable option when one does not have access to
a formal synonym model (like WordNet-based augmentation). The use of
\emph{mixup} further improves performance of all text based augmentations and
reduces the effects of overfitting on a tested deep learning model. Round-trip
translation with a translation service proves to be harder to use due to cost
and as such is less accessible for both normal and low resource use-cases.
