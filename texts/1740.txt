In this paper, with the aim of addressing the stringent computing and
quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of recently introduced advanced
multimedia services, we consider a cell-free massive MIMO-enabled mobile edge
network. In particular, benefited from the reliable cell-free links to offload
intensive computation to the edge server, resource-constrained end-users can
augment on-board (local) processing with edge computing. To this end, we
formulate a joint communication and computing resource allocation (JCCRA)
problem to minimize the total energy consumption of the users, while meeting
the respective user-specific deadlines. To tackle the problem, we propose a
fully distributed solution approach based on cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework, wherein each user is implemented as a
learning agent to make joint resource allocation relying on local information
only. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed
distributed approach outperforms the heuristic baselines, converging to a
centralized target benchmark, without resorting to large overhead. Moreover, we
showed that the proposed algorithm has performed significantly better in
cell-free system as compared with the cellular MEC systems, e.g., a small
cell-based MEC system.
