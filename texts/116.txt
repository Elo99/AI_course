This paper proposes a handwritten text recognition(HTR) system that
outperforms current state-of-the-artmethods. The comparison was carried out on
three of themost frequently used in HTR task datasets, namely Ben-tham, IAM,
and Saint Gall. In addition, the results on tworecently presented datasets,
Peter the Greats manuscriptsand HKR Dataset, are provided.The paper describes
the architecture of the neural net-work and two ways of increasing the volume
of train-ing data: augmentation that simulates strikethrough text(HandWritten
Blots) and a new text generation method(StackMix), which proved to be very
effective in HTR tasks.StackMix can also be applied to the standalone task of
gen-erating handwritten text based on printed text.
