AI fairy tale companions play an important role in early childhood education
as an augmentation for parents' efforts to close the participation gap and
boost kids' mental and language development. Existing systems are generally
designed to provide vivid materials as unidirectional entertaining reading
environments, e.g, visualizing inputting texts. However, due to the limited
vocabulary of kids, these systems failed to afford effective interaction to
motivate kids to write their own fairy tales. In this work, we propose AI.R
Taletorium, an illustrative, immersive, and inclusive multimodal AI companion,
for interactive fairy tale co-creation that actively involves kids to create
fairy tales with both the AI agent and their normal peers. AI.R Taletorium
consists a neural story generator and a doodler-based fairy tale visualizer. We
design a character-centric bidirectional connection mechanism between the story
generator and visualizer equipped with Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP), thus enabling kids to participant in the story generation process by
simple sketching. Extensive experiments and user studies show that our system
was able to generate and visualize meaningful and vivid fairy tales with
limited training data and complete the full interaction cycle under various
inputs (text, doodler) through the bidirectional connection.
