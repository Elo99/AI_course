We present the DeepHist - a novel Deep Learning framework for augmenting a
network by histogram layers and demonstrate its strength by addressing
image-to-image translation problems. Specifically, given an input image and a
reference color distribution we aim to generate an output image with the
structural appearance (content) of the input (source) yet with the colors of
the reference. The key idea is a new technique for a differentiable
construction of joint and color histograms of the output images. We further
define a color distribution loss based on the Earth Mover's Distance between
the output's and the reference's color histograms and a Mutual Information loss
based on the joint histograms of the source and the output images. Promising
results are shown for the tasks of color transfer, image colorization and edges
$\rightarrow$ photo, where the color distribution of the output image is
controlled. Comparison to Pix2Pix and CyclyGANs are shown.
