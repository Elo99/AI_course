Data augmentation has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the
performance of deep neural networks and led to state-of-the-art results in
computer vision. However, state-of-the-art data augmentation strongly distorts
training images, leading to a disparity between examples seen during training
and inference. In this work, we explore a recently proposed training paradigm
in order to correct for this disparity: using an auxiliary BatchNorm for the
potentially out-of-distribution, strongly augmented images. Our experiments
then focus on how to define the BatchNorm parameters that are used at
evaluation. To eliminate the train-test disparity, we experiment with using the
batch statistics defined by clean training images only, yet surprisingly find
that this does not yield improvements in model performance. Instead, we
investigate using BatchNorm parameters defined by weak augmentations and find
that this method significantly improves the performance of common image
classification benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. We then
explore a fundamental trade-off between accuracy and robustness coming from
using different BatchNorm parameters, providing greater insight into the
benefits of data augmentation on model performance.
