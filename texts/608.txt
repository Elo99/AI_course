Linear augmentation has recently been shown to be effective in targeting
desired stationary solutions, suppressing bistablity, in regulating the
dynamics of drive response systems and in controlling the dynamics of hidden
attractors. The simplicity of the procedure is the highlight of this scheme but
at the same time questions related to its general applicability still need to
be addressed. Focusing on the issue of targeting stationary solutions, this
work demonstrates instances where the scheme fails to stabilize the required
solutions and leads to other complicated dynamical scenarios. Appropriate
examples from conservative as well as dissipative systems are presented in this
regard and potential applications for relevant observations in dissipative
predator--prey systems are also discussed.
