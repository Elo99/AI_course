We present a deep learning method for singing voice conversion. The proposed
network is not conditioned on the text or on the notes, and it directly
converts the audio of one singer to the voice of another. Training is performed
without any form of supervision: no lyrics or any kind of phonetic features, no
notes, and no matching samples between singers. The proposed network employs a
single CNN encoder for all singers, a single WaveNet decoder, and a classifier
that enforces the latent representation to be singer-agnostic. Each singer is
represented by one embedding vector, which the decoder is conditioned on. In
order to deal with relatively small datasets, we propose a new data
augmentation scheme, as well as new training losses and protocols that are
based on backtranslation. Our evaluation presents evidence that the conversion
produces natural signing voices that are highly recognizable as the target
singer.
