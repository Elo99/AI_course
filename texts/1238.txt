Explainable NLP (ExNLP) has increasingly focused on collecting
human-annotated textual explanations. These explanations are used downstream in
three ways: as data augmentation to improve performance on a predictive task,
as supervision to train models to produce explanations for their predictions,
and as a ground-truth to evaluate model-generated explanations. In this review,
we identify 65 datasets with three predominant classes of textual explanations
(highlights, free-text, and structured), organize the literature on annotating
each type, identify strengths and shortcomings of existing collection
methodologies, and give recommendations for collecting ExNLP datasets in the
future.
