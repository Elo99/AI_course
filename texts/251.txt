Text-to-SQL parsers typically struggle with databases unseen during the train
time. Adapting parsers to new databases is a challenging problem due to the
lack of natural language queries in the new schemas. We present ReFill, a
framework for synthesizing high-quality and textually diverse parallel datasets
for adapting a Text-to-SQL parser to a target schema. ReFill learns to
retrieve-and-edit text queries from the existing schemas and transfers them to
the target schema. We show that retrieving diverse existing text, masking their
schema-specific tokens, and refilling with tokens relevant to the target
schema, leads to significantly more diverse text queries than achievable by
standard SQL-to-Text generation methods. Through experiments spanning multiple
databases, we demonstrate that fine-tuning parsers on datasets synthesized
using ReFill consistently outperforms the prior data-augmentation methods.
