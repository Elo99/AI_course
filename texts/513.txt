Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use decoding algorithms to control
prosthetic devices based on brain signals for restoration of lost function.
Computer-brain interfaces (CBIs), on the other hand, use encoding algorithms to
transform external sensory signals into neural stimulation patterns for
restoring sensation or providing sensory feedback for closed-loop prosthetic
control. In this article, we introduce brain co-processors, devices that
combine decoding and encoding in a unified framework using artificial
intelligence (AI) to supplement or augment brain function. Brain co-processors
can be used for a range of applications, from inducing Hebbian plasticity for
rehabilitation after brain injury to reanimating paralyzed limbs and enhancing
memory. A key challenge is simultaneous multi-channel neural decoding and
encoding for optimization of external behavioral or task-related goals. We
describe a new framework for developing brain co-processors based on artificial
neural networks, deep learning and reinforcement learning. These "neural
co-processors" allow joint optimization of cost functions with the nervous
system to achieve desired behaviors. By coupling artificial neural networks
with their biological counterparts, neural co-processors offer a new way of
restoring and augmenting the brain, as well as a new scientific tool for brain
research. We conclude by discussing the potential applications and ethical
implications of brain co-processors.
