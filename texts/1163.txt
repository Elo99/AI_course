Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is still a challenging problem because it
must deal with two important difficulties: the variability among writing
styles, and the scarcity of labelled data. To alleviate such problems,
synthetic data generation and data augmentation are typically used to train HTR
systems. However, training with such data produces encouraging but still
inaccurate transcriptions in real words. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised writer adaptation approach that is able to automatically adjust a
generic handwritten word recognizer, fully trained with synthetic fonts,
towards a new incoming writer. We have experimentally validated our proposal
using five different datasets, covering several challenges (i) the document
source: modern and historic samples, which may involve paper degradation
problems; (ii) different handwriting styles: single and multiple writer
collections; and (iii) language, which involves different character
combinations. Across these challenging collections, we show that our system is
able to maintain its performance, thus, it provides a practical and generic
approach to deal with new document collections without requiring any expensive
and tedious manual annotation step.
