This paper gives an overview of the Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking
task of the 8th Dialogue System Technology Challenge. The goal of this task is
to develop dialogue state tracking models suitable for large-scale virtual
assistants, with a focus on data-efficient joint modeling across domains and
zero-shot generalization to new APIs. This task provided a new dataset
consisting of over 16000 dialogues in the training set spanning 16 domains to
highlight these challenges, and a baseline model capable of zero-shot
generalization to new APIs. Twenty-five teams participated, developing a range
of neural network models, exceeding the performance of the baseline model by a
very high margin. The submissions incorporated a variety of pre-trained
encoders and data augmentation techniques. This paper describes the task
definition, dataset and evaluation methodology. We also summarize the approach
and results of the submitted systems to highlight the overall trends in the
state-of-the-art.
