Text data augmentation, i.e., the creation of new textual data from an
existing text, is challenging. Indeed, augmentation transformations should take
into account language complexity while being relevant to the target Natural
Language Processing (NLP) task (e.g., Machine Translation, Text
Classification). Initially motivated by an application of Business Email
Compromise (BEC) detection, we propose a corpus and task agnostic augmentation
framework used as a service to augment English texts within our company. Our
proposal combines different methods, utilizing BERT language model, multi-step
back-translation and heuristics. We show that our augmentation framework
improves performances on several text classification tasks using publicly
available models and corpora as well as on a BEC detection task. We also
provide a comprehensive argumentation about the limitations of our augmentation
framework.
