Optical character recognition (OCR) technology has been widely used in
various scenes, as shown in Figure 1. Designing a practical OCR system is still
a meaningful but challenging task. In previous work, considering the efficiency
and accuracy, we proposed a practical ultra lightweight OCR system (PP-OCR),
and an optimized version PP-OCRv2. In order to further improve the performance
of PP-OCRv2, a more robust OCR system PP-OCRv3 is proposed in this paper.
PP-OCRv3 upgrades the text detection model and text recognition model in 9
aspects based on PP-OCRv2. For text detector, we introduce a PAN module with
large receptive field named LK-PAN, a FPN module with residual attention
mechanism named RSE-FPN, and DML distillation strategy. For text recognizer,
the base model is replaced from CRNN to SVTR, and we introduce lightweight text
recognition network SVTR LCNet, guided training of CTC by attention, data
augmentation strategy TextConAug, better pre-trained model by self-supervised
TextRotNet, UDML, and UIM to accelerate the model and improve the effect.
Experiments on real data show that the hmean of PP-OCRv3 is 5% higher than
PP-OCRv2 under comparable inference speed. All the above mentioned models are
open-sourced and the code is available in the GitHub repository PaddleOCR which
is powered by PaddlePaddle.
