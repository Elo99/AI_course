This paper describes the recent development of ESPnet
(https://github.com/espnet/espnet), an end-to-end speech processing toolkit.
This project was initiated in December 2017 to mainly deal with end-to-end
speech recognition experiments based on sequence-to-sequence modeling. The
project has grown rapidly and now covers a wide range of speech processing
applications. Now ESPnet also includes text to speech (TTS), voice conversation
(VC), speech translation (ST), and speech enhancement (SE) with support for
beamforming, speech separation, denoising, and dereverberation. All
applications are trained in an end-to-end manner, thanks to the generic
sequence to sequence modeling properties, and they can be further integrated
and jointly optimized. Also, ESPnet provides reproducible all-in-one recipes
for these applications with state-of-the-art performance in various benchmarks
by incorporating transformer, advanced data augmentation, and conformer. This
project aims to provide up-to-date speech processing experience to the
community so that researchers in academia and various industry scales can
develop their technologies collaboratively.
