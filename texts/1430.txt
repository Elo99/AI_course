This work presents an analysis of the efficiency of image augmentations for
the face recognition problem from limited data. We considered basic
manipulations, generative methods, and their combinations for augmentations.
Our results show that augmentations, in general, can considerably improve the
quality of face recognition systems and the combination of generative and basic
approaches performs better than the other tested techniques.
