For the low-energy anti-neutrino reaction, $\bar{\nu}_e + p \to e^+ + n$,
which is of great current interest in connection with on-going high-precision
neutrino-oscillation experiments, we calculate the differential cross section
in a model-independent effective field theory (EFT), taking into account
radiative corrections of order $\alpha$. In EFT, the short-distance radiative
corrections are subsumed into well-defined low-energy constants the values of
which can in principle be determined from the available neutron beta-decay
data. In our low-energy EFT, the order-$\alpha$ radiative corrections are
considered to be of the same order as the nucleon recoil corrections, which
include the "weak magnetism" contribution. These recoil corrections have been
evaluated as well. We emphasize that EFT allows for a systematic evaluation of
higher order corrections, providing estimates of theoretical uncertainties in
our results.
