Existing approaches for automated essay scoring and document representation
learning typically rely on discourse parsers to incorporate discourse structure
into text representation. However, the performance of parsers is not always
adequate, especially when they are used on noisy texts, such as student essays.
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised pre-training approach to capture
discourse structure of essays in terms of coherence and cohesion that does not
require any discourse parser or annotation. We introduce several types of
token, sentence and paragraph-level corruption techniques for our proposed
pre-training approach and augment masked language modeling pre-training with
our pre-training method to leverage both contextualized and discourse
information. Our proposed unsupervised approach achieves new state-of-the-art
result on essay Organization scoring task.
