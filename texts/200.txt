Math Anxiety is experienced by students. This is caused mainly by poor
academic performance specifically in Calculus and Precalculus in Mathematics.
From 2014 to 2016, an average rating of 70.33 percent for secondary education
and 71.1 percent for elementary was generated during several exams, such as the
National Achievement Test. The result produced is said to be below the national
passing percentage, which shows that Filipino student performance in
mathematics is very poor indeed. Taking into consideration the proof of the
existence of these problems, it is necessary to try and test a need for a
technology which has never before been used as a remedy. Augmented reality is
deemed to be one of the advances in technology that is found to have a good
effect not only on the health of the student, but also on the learning of
Mathematics. Combining the two positive effects of Augmented Reality and the
very impressive outcome of a game-based learning technique in mathematics, it
is wise to say that an Augmented Reality Game-based learning method can be used
as a supplement in Precalculus and Calculus teaching.
