In this note we construct augmentations of Chekanov-Eliashberg algebras of
certain high dimensional Legendrian submanifolds that are not induced by exact
Lagrangian fillings. The obstructions to the existence of exact Lagrangian
fillings that we use are Seidel's isomorphism and the injectivity of a certain
algebraic map between the corresponding augmentation varieties proven by Gao
and Rutherford. To the best of the author's knowledge, these are the first high
dimensional examples of this type.
