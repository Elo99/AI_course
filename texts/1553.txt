The addressing of a particular qubit within a quantum register is a key
prerequisite for scalable quantum computing. In general, executing a quantum
gate with a single qubit, or a subset of qubits, affects the quantum states of
all other qubits. This reduced fidelity of the whole quantum register could
prevent the application of quantum error correction protocols and thus preclude
scalability. We demonstrate addressing of individual qubits within a quantum
byte (eight qubits) and measure the error induced in all non-addressed qubits
(cross-talk) associated with the application of single-qubit gates. The quantum
byte is implemented using microwave-driven hyperfine qubits of $^{171}$Yb$^+$
ions confined in a Paul trap augmented with a magnetic gradient field. The
measured cross-talk is on the order of $10^{-5}$ and therefore below the
threshold commonly agreed sufficient to efficiently realize fault-tolerant
quantum computing. Hence, our results demonstrate how this threshold can be
overcome with respect to cross-talk.
