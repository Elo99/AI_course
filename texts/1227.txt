In this study, we present recent developments on ESPnet: End-to-End Speech
Processing toolkit, which mainly involves a recently proposed architecture
called Conformer, Convolution-augmented Transformer. This paper shows the
results for a wide range of end-to-end speech processing applications, such as
automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translations (ST), speech separation
(SS) and text-to-speech (TTS). Our experiments reveal various training tips and
significant performance benefits obtained with the Conformer on different
tasks. These results are competitive or even outperform the current
state-of-art Transformer models. We are preparing to release all-in-one recipes
using open source and publicly available corpora for all the above tasks with
pre-trained models. Our aim for this work is to contribute to our research
community by reducing the burden of preparing state-of-the-art research
environments usually requiring high resources.
