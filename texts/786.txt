Pointer-generator network is an extremely popular method of text
summarization. More recent works in this domain still build on top of the
baseline pointer generator by augmenting a content selection phase, or by
decomposing the decoder into a contextual network and a language model.
However, all such models that are based on the pointer-generator base
architecture cannot generate novel words in the summary and mostly copy words
from the source text. In our work, we first thoroughly investigate why the
pointer-generator network is unable to generate novel words, and then address
that by adding an Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) penalty. This enables us to improve
the amount of novelty/abstraction significantly. We use normalized n-gram
novelty scores as a metric for determining the level of abstraction. Moreover,
we also report rouge scores of our model since most summarization models are
evaluated with R-1, R-2, R-L scores.
