How to solve the data scarcity problem for end-to-end speech-to-text
translation (ST)? It's well known that data augmentation is an efficient method
to improve performance for many tasks by enlarging the dataset. In this paper,
we propose Mix at three levels for Speech Translation (M^3ST) method to
increase the diversity of the augmented training corpus. Specifically, we
conduct two phases of fine-tuning based on a pre-trained model using external
machine translation (MT) data. In the first stage of fine-tuning, we mix the
training corpus at three levels, including word level, sentence level and frame
level, and fine-tune the entire model with mixed data. At the second stage of
fine-tuning, we take both original speech sequences and original text sequences
in parallel into the model to fine-tune the network, and use Jensen-Shannon
divergence to regularize their outputs. Experiments on MuST-C speech
translation benchmark and analysis show that M^3ST outperforms current strong
baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on eight directions with an
average BLEU of 29.9.
