In this paper, some enhanced error estimates are derived for the augmented
subspace methods which are designed for solving eigenvalue problems. We will
show that the augmented subspace methods have the second order convergence rate
which is better than the existing results. These sharper estimates provide a
new dependence of convergence rate on the coarse spaces in augmented subspace
methods. These new results are also validated by some numerical examples.
