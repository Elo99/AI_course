We propose automated augmented conjugate inference, a new inference method
for non-conjugate Gaussian processes (GP) models. Our method automatically
constructs an auxiliary variable augmentation that renders the GP model
conditionally conjugate. Building on the conjugate structure of the augmented
model, we develop two inference methods. First, a fast and scalable stochastic
variational inference method that uses efficient block coordinate ascent
updates, which are computed in closed form. Second, an asymptotically correct
Gibbs sampler that is useful for small datasets. Our experiments show that our
method are up two orders of magnitude faster and more robust than existing
state-of-the-art black-box methods.
