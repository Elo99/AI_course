E-commerce stores collect customer feedback to let sellers learn about
customer concerns and enhance customer order experience. Because customer
feedback often contains redundant information, a concise summary of the
feedback can be generated to help sellers better understand the issues causing
customer dissatisfaction. Previous state-of-the-art abstractive text
summarization models make two major types of factual errors when producing
summaries from customer feedback, which are wrong entity detection (WED) and
incorrect product-defect description (IPD). In this work, we introduce a set of
methods to enhance the factual consistency of abstractive summarization on
customer feedback. We augment the training data with artificially corrupted
summaries, and use them as counterparts of the target summaries. We add a
contrastive loss term into the training objective so that the model learns to
avoid certain factual errors. Evaluation results show that a large portion of
WED and IPD errors are alleviated for BART and T5. Furthermore, our approaches
do not depend on the structure of the summarization model and thus are
generalizable to any abstractive summarization systems.
