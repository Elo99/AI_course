In this paper, we propose a three-stage training methodology to improve the
speech recognition accuracy of low-resource languages. We explore and propose
an effective combination of techniques such as transfer learning, encoder
freezing, data augmentation using Text-To-Speech (TTS), and Semi-Supervised
Learning (SSL). To improve the accuracy of a low-resource Italian ASR, we
leverage a well-trained English model, unlabeled text corpus, and unlabeled
audio corpus using transfer learning, TTS augmentation, and SSL respectively.
In the first stage, we use transfer learning from a well-trained English model.
This primarily helps in learning the acoustic information from a resource-rich
language. This stage achieves around 24% relative Word Error Rate (WER)
reduction over the baseline. In stage two, We utilize unlabeled text data via
TTS data-augmentation to incorporate language information into the model. We
also explore freezing the acoustic encoder at this stage. TTS data augmentation
helps us further reduce the WER by ~ 21% relatively. Finally, In stage three we
reduce the WER by another 4% relative by using SSL from unlabeled audio data.
Overall, our two-pass speech recognition system with a Monotonic Chunkwise
Attention (MoChA) in the first pass and a full-attention in the second pass
achieves a WER reduction of ~ 42% relative to the baseline.
