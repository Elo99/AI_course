Speech-enabled systems typically first convert audio to text through an
automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and then feed the text to downstream
natural language processing (NLP) modules. The errors of the ASR system can
seriously downgrade the performance of the NLP modules. Therefore, it is
essential to make them robust to the ASR errors. Previous work has shown it is
effective to employ data augmentation methods to solve this problem by
injecting ASR noise during the training process. In this paper, we utilize the
prevalent pre-trained language model to generate training samples with
ASR-plausible noise. Compare to the previous methods, our approach generates
ASR noise that better fits the real-world error distribution. Experimental
results on spoken language translation(SLT) and spoken language understanding
(SLU) show that our approach effectively improves the system robustness against
the ASR errors and achieves state-of-the-art results on both tasks.
