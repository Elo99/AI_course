This study presents a new approach to metaphorical paraphrase generation by
masking literal tokens of literal sentences and unmasking them with
metaphorical language models. Unlike similar studies, the proposed algorithm
does not only focus on verbs but also on nouns and adjectives. Despite the fact
that the transfer rate for the former is the highest (56%), the transfer of the
latter is feasible (24% and 31%). Human evaluation showed that our
system-generated metaphors are considered more creative and metaphorical than
human-generated ones while when using our transferred metaphors for data
augmentation improves the state of the art in metaphorical sentence
classification by 3% in F1.
