Modern object detection architectures are moving towards employing
self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve performance detection with related
pretext tasks. Pretext tasks for monocular 3D object detection have not yet
been explored yet in literature. The paper studies the application of
established self-supervised bounding box recycling by labeling random windows
as the pretext task. The classifier head of the 3D detector is trained to
classify random windows containing different proportions of the ground truth
objects, thus handling the foreground-background imbalance. We evaluate the
pretext task using the RTM3D detection model as baseline, with and without the
application of data augmentation. We demonstrate improvements of between 2-3 %
in mAP 3D and 0.9-1.5 % BEV scores using SSL over the baseline scores. We
propose the inverse class frequency re-weighted (ICFW) mAP score that
highlights improvements in detection for low frequency classes in a class
imbalanced dataset with long tails. We demonstrate improvements in ICFW both
mAP 3D and BEV scores to take into account the class imbalance in the KITTI
validation dataset. We see 4-5 % increase in ICFW metric with the pretext task.
