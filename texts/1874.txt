A brief introduction to the projector augmented wave method is given and
recent developments are reviewed. The projector augmented wave method is an
all-electron method for efficient ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations with
the full wave functions. It extends and combines the traditions of existing
augmented wave methods and the pseudopotential approach. Without sacrificing
efficiency, the PAW method avoids transferability problems of the
pseudopotential approach and it has been valuable to predict properties that
depend on the full wave functions.
