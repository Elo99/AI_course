Properties of hot dense ultrarelativistic spinor matter in a slab of finite
width, placed in a transverse uniform magnetic field, are studied. The
admissible set of boundary conditions is determined by the requirement that
spinor matter be confined inside the slab. In thermal equilibrium, the chiral
separation effect in the slab is shown to depend on both temperature and
chemical potential; this is distinct from the unrealistic case of the magnetic
field filling the unbounded (infinite) medium, when the effect is temperature
independent. In the realistic case of the slab, a stepwise behaviour of the
axial current density at zero temperature is smoothed out as temperature
increases, turning into a linear behaviour at infinitely large temperature. A
choice of boundary conditions can facilitate either augmentation or attenuation
of the chiral separation effect; in particular, the effect can persist even at
zero chemical potential, if temperature is finite. Thus the boundary condition
can serve as a source that is additional to the spinor matter density.
