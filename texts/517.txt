Self-supervised Learning (SSL) including the mainstream contrastive learning
has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data
annotations. However, most methods mainly focus on the instance level
information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should
have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of
attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we
introduce a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised
learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the
relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method
employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different
instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the
feature embeddings of different augmentations. To boost the performance, we
argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more reliable relation, and
leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency. The designed asymmetric
predictor head and an InfoNCE warm-up strategy enhance the robustness to
hyper-parameters and benefit the resulting performance. Experimental results
show that our proposed ReSSL substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods across different network architectures, including various lightweight
networks (\eg, EfficientNet and MobileNet).
