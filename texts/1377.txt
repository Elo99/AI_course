Intending to support new emerging applications with latency requirements
below what can be offered by the cloud data centers, the edge and fog computing
paradigms have reared. In such systems, the real-time instant data is processed
closer to the edge of the network, instead of the remote data centers. With the
advances in edge and fog computing systems, novel and efficient solutions based
on Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) emerge and play critical roles in system
design. Several DHT-based solutions have been proposed to either augment the
scalability and efficiency of edge and fog computing infrastructures or to
enable application-specific functionalities such as task and resource
management. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the
state-of-the-art DHT-based architectures in edge and fog computing systems from
the lenses of infrastructure and application. Moreover, the paper details the
open problems and discusses future research guidelines for the DHT-based edge
and fog computing systems.
