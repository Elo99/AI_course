We study the effects of including Yukawa-like dimension-5 operators in the
Georgi-Machacek model where the Standard Model is augmented with triplet
scalars. We focus only on the charged Higgs sector and investigate the
constraints arising from radiative B-meson decays, neutral B-meson mixing and
precision measurement of Zbb vertex. We observe that the inclusion of the
dimension-5 operators causes substantial alteration of the limits on the
charged Higgs masses and the vacuum expectation value of the triplets, derived
otherwise using only the dimension-4 operators.
