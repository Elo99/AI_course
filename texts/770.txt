Supporting programming on touchscreen devices requires effective text input
and editing methods. Unfortunately, the virtual keyboard can be inefficient and
uses valuable screen space on already small devices. Recent advances in stylus
input make handwriting a potentially viable text input solution for programming
on touchscreen devices. The primary barrier, however, is that handwriting
recognition systems are built to take advantage of the rules of natural
language, not those of a programming language. In this paper, we explore this
particular problem of handwriting recognition for source code. We collect and
make publicly available a dataset of handwritten Python code samples from 15
participants and we characterize the typical recognition errors for this
handwritten Python source code when using a state-of-the-art handwriting
recognition tool. We present an approach to improve the recognition accuracy by
augmenting a handwriting recognizer with the programming language grammar
rules. Our experiment on the collected dataset shows an 8.6% word error rate
and a 3.6% character error rate which outperforms standard handwriting
recognition systems and compares favorably to typing source code on virtual
keyboards.
