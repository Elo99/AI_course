Instance segmentation is applied widely in image editing, image analysis and
autonomous driving, etc. However, insufficient data is a common problem in
practical applications. The Visual Inductive Priors(VIPriors) Instance
Segmentation Challenge has focused on this problem. VIPriors for Data-Efficient
Computer Vision Challenges ask competitors to train models from scratch in a
data-deficient setting, but there are some visual inductive priors that can be
used. In order to address the VIPriors instance segmentation problem, we
designed a Task-Specific Data Augmentation(TS-DA) strategy and Inference
Processing(TS-IP) strategy. The main purpose of task-specific data augmentation
strategy is to tackle the data-deficient problem. And in order to make the most
of visual inductive priors, we designed a task-specific inference processing
strategy. We demonstrate the applicability of proposed method on VIPriors
Instance Segmentation Challenge. The segmentation model applied is Hybrid Task
Cascade based detector on the Swin-Base based CBNetV2 backbone. Experimental
results demonstrate that proposed method can achieve a competitive result on
the test set of 2022 VIPriors Instance Segmentation Challenge, with 0.531
