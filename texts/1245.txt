Despite ongoing advancements in quantum computing, businesses are still faced
with the problem to decide if they would benefit from investing into this novel
technology for building a business critical application. This uncertainty is
not only owing to the limitations in the current state of the technology but
also due to the gap between the level at which business applications are
analyzed (e.g., using high level semi-formal languages) and the level at which
quantum computing related information is currently available (e.g., formally
specified computational problems, their algorithmic solutions with
computational complexity theoretic analysis) to make informed decisions. To
fill the discourse gap, in this paper, we present design of an interactive
advisor, which augments users while deciding to invest into quantum software
development as a plausible future option in their application context. Towards
that we apply business process modeling and natural language similarity
analysis using text-embeddings to associated business context with
computational problems and formulate constraints in terms of quantum speedup
and resource requirements to select software development platforms.
