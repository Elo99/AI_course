A problem with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is that they require
large datasets to obtain adequate robustness; on small datasets, they are prone
to overfitting. Many methods have been proposed to overcome this shortcoming
with CNNs. In cases where additional samples cannot easily be collected, a
common approach is to generate more data points from existing data using an
augmentation technique. In image classification, many augmentation approaches
utilize simple image manipulation algorithms. In this work, we build ensembles
on the data level by adding images generated by combining fourteen augmentation
approaches, three of which are proposed here for the first time. These novel
methods are based on the Fourier Transform (FT), the Radon Transform (RT) and
the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Pretrained ResNet50 networks are finetuned
on training sets that include images derived from each augmentation method.
These networks and several fusions are evaluated and compared across eleven
benchmarks. Results show that building ensembles on the data level by combining
different data augmentation methods produce classifiers that not only compete
competitively against the state-of-the-art but often surpass the best
approaches reported in the literature.
