There are two reasons why uncertainty about the future yield of investments
may not be adequately described by Probability Theory. The first one is due to
unique or nearly-unique events, that either never realized or occurred too
seldom for probabilities to be reliable. The second one arises when when one
fears that something may happen, that one is not even able to figure out, e.g.,
if one asks: "Climate change, financial crises, pandemic, war, what next?"
  In both cases, simple one-to-one causal mappings between available
alternatives and possible consequences eventually melt down. However, such
destructions reflect into the changing narratives of business executives,
employees and other stakeholders in specific, identifiable and differential
ways. In particular, texts such as consultants' reports or letters to
shareholders can be analysed in order to detect the impact of both sorts of
uncertainty onto the causal relations that normally guide decision-making.
  We propose structural measures of causal mappings as a means to measure
non-probabilistic uncertainty, eventually suggesting that automated text
analysis can greatly augment the possibilities offered by these techniques.
Prospective applications may concern statistical institutes, stock market
traders, as well as businesses wishing to compare their own vision to those
prevailing in their industry.
