Relation extraction that is the task of predicting semantic relation type
between entities in a sentence or document is an important task in natural
language processing. Although there are many researches and datasets for
English, Persian suffers from sufficient researches and comprehensive datasets.
The only available Persian dataset for this task is PERLEX, which is a Persian
expert-translated version of the SemEval-2010-Task-8 dataset. In this paper, we
present our augmented dataset and the results and findings of our system,
participated in the Persian relation Extraction shared task of NSURL 2021
workshop. We use PERLEX as the base dataset and enhance it by applying some
text preprocessing steps and by increasing its size via data augmentation
techniques to improve the generalization and robustness of applied models. We
then employ two different models including ParsBERT and multilingual BERT for
relation extraction on the augmented PERLEX dataset. Our best model obtained
64.67% of Macro-F1 on the test phase of the contest and it achieved 83.68% of
Macro-F1 on the test set of PERLEX.
