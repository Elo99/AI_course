BACKGROUND: Augmented reality (AR) is gaining popularity in varying field
such as computer gaming and medical education fields. However, still few of
applications in real surgeries. Orthopedic surgical applications are currently
limited and underdeveloped. - METHODS: The clinic validation was prepared with
the currently available AR equipment and software. A total of 1 Vertebroplasty,
2 ORIF Pelvis fracture, 1 ORIF with PFN for Proximal Femoral Fracture, 1 CRIF
for distal radius fracture and 2 ORIF for Tibia Fracture cases were performed
with fluoroscopy combined with AR smart surgical glasses system. - RESULTS: A
total of 1 Vertebroplasty, 2 ORIF Pelvis fracture, 1 ORIF with PFN for Proximal
Femoral Fracture, 1 CRIF for distal radius fracture and 2 ORIF for Tibia
Fracture cases are performed to evaluate the benefits of AR surgery. Among the
AR surgeries, surgeons wear the smart surgical are lot reduce of eyes of turns
to focus on the monitors. This paper shows the potential ability of augmented
reality technology for trauma surgery.
