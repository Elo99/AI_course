Simple yet effective data augmentation techniques have been proposed for
sentence-level and sentence-pair natural language processing tasks. Inspired by
these efforts, we design and compare data augmentation for named entity
recognition, which is usually modeled as a token-level sequence labeling
problem. Through experiments on two data sets from the biomedical and materials
science domains (i2b2-2010 and MaSciP), we show that simple augmentation can
boost performance for both recurrent and transformer-based models, especially
for small training sets.
