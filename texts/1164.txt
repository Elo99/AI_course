This paper addresses the problem of comprehending procedural commonsense
knowledge. This is a challenging task as it requires identifying key entities,
keeping track of their state changes, and understanding temporal and causal
relations. Contrary to most of the previous work, in this study, we do not rely
on strong inductive bias and explore the question of how multimodality can be
exploited to provide a complementary semantic signal. Towards this end, we
introduce a new entity-aware neural comprehension model augmented with external
relational memory units. Our model learns to dynamically update entity states
in relation to each other while reading the text instructions. Our experimental
analysis on the visual reasoning tasks in the recently proposed RecipeQA
dataset reveals that our approach improves the accuracy of the previously
reported models by a large margin. Moreover, we find that our model learns
effective dynamic representations of entities even though we do not use any
supervision at the level of entity states.
