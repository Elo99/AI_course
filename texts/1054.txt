Ba2ScSbO6 (BSS) has been synthesized in polycrystalline form by solid state
reaction. Structural characterization of the compound was done through X-ray
diffraction (XRD) followed by Riedvelt analysis of the XRD pattern. The crystal
structure is cubic, space group Fm-3m (No. 225. Optical band-gap of the present
system has been calculated using the UV-Vis Spectroscopy to be 4.2eV. A
detailed study of the electronic properties has also been carried out using the
Full-Potential Linear Augmented Plane Wave (FPLAPW) as implemented in WIEN2k.
BSS is found to be a large band-gap insulator with potential technological
applications, such as dielectric resonators and filers in microwave
applications
