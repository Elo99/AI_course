Training accurate intent classifiers requires labeled data, which can be
costly to obtain. Data augmentation methods may ameliorate this issue, but the
quality of the generated data varies significantly across techniques. We study
the process of systematically producing pseudo-labeled data given a small seed
set using a wide variety of data augmentation techniques, including mixing
methods together. We find that while certain methods dramatically improve
qualitative and quantitative performance, other methods have minimal or even
negative impact. We also analyze key considerations when implementing data
augmentation methods in production.
