Robo-AO is the first autonomous laser adaptive optics system and science
instrument operating on sky. With minimal human oversight, the system
robotically executes large scale surveys, monitors long-term astrophysical
dynamics and characterizes newly discovered transients, all at the visible
diffraction limit. The average target-to target operational overhead, including
slew time, is a mere 86 s, enabling up to ~20 observations per hour. The first
of many envisioned systems went live in June 2012, and has since finished 78
nights of science observing at the Palomar Observatory 60-inch (1.5 m)
telescope, with over 9,000 robotic observations executed as of August 2013. The
system will be augmented in 2014 with a low-noise wide field infrared camera,
which will double as a tip-tilt sensor, to widen the spectral bandwidth of
observations, increase available sky coverage as well as enable deeper visible
imaging using adaptive-optics sharpened infrared tip-tilt guide sources.
