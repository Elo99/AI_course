The augmented space formalism coupled with the recursion method and a
tight-binding linear Muffin-tin orbitals basis has been applied to study the
effects of roughness on the properties of (001) surfaces of body-centered cubic
Fe and face-centered cubic Co and Ni. The formalism is also proposed for the
study of smooth surface. Comparisons have been made for three types of
surfaces: a smooth surface, the surface with a rough top layer, and a more
realistic model with several rough top layers converging into a crystalline
bulk. Comparisons have been made between the magnetic moments, work function
and electronic density of states in the three models described above.
