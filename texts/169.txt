Text-to-SQL semantic parsing is an important NLP task, which greatly
facilitates the interaction between users and the database and becomes the key
component in many human-computer interaction systems. Much recent progress in
text-to-SQL has been driven by large-scale datasets, but most of them are
centered on English. In this work, we present MultiSpider, the largest
multilingual text-to-SQL dataset which covers seven languages (English, German,
French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese). Upon MultiSpider, we
further identify the lexical and structural challenges of text-to-SQL (caused
by specific language properties and dialect sayings) and their intensity across
different languages. Experimental results under three typical settings
(zero-shot, monolingual and multilingual) reveal a 6.1% absolute drop in
accuracy in non-English languages. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are
conducted to understand the reason for the performance drop of each language.
Besides the dataset, we also propose a simple schema augmentation framework
SAVe (Schema-Augmentation-with-Verification), which significantly boosts the
overall performance by about 1.8% and closes the 29.5% performance gap across
languages.
