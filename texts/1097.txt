Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have gained a lot of popularity from
their introduction in 2014 till present. Research on GAN is rapidly growing and
there are many variants of the original GAN focusing on various aspects of deep
learning. GAN are perceived as the most impactful direction of machine learning
in the last decade. This paper focuses on the application of GAN in autonomous
driving including topics such as advanced data augmentation, loss function
learning, semi-supervised learning, etc. We formalize and review key
applications of adversarial techniques and discuss challenges and open problems
to be addressed.
