With an ever-increasing amount of astronomical data being collected, manual
classification has become obsolete; and machine learning is the only way
forward. Keeping this in mind, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Team
hosted the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge
(PLAsTiCC) in 2018. The aim of this challenge was to develop models that
accurately classify astronomical sources into different classes, scaling from a
limited training set to a large test set. In this text, we report our results
of experimenting with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based deep
learning models to deal with time series data of the PLAsTiCC dataset. We
demonstrate that GRUs are indeed suitable to handle time series data. With
minimum preprocessing and without augmentation, our stacked ensemble of GRU and
Dense networks achieves an accuracy of 76.243%. Data from astronomical surveys
such as LSST will help researchers answer questions pertaining to dark matter,
dark energy and the origins of the universe; accurate classification of
astronomical sources is the first step towards achieving this.
