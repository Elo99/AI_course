A possibility of explaining the anomalies in the semileptonic $B$-meson decay
$B \to K^{*} \mu \bar\mu$ has been explored in the framework of the gauged
$U(1)_{\mu-\tau}$ symmetry. Apart from the muon anomalous magnetic moment and
neutrino sector, we formulate the model starting with a valid Lagrangian and
consider the constraints from the neutral meson mixings, the bounds on direct
detection and the relic density of the bosonic dark matter candidate augmented
to collider constraints. We search the parameter space, which accommodates the
size of the anomaly of the $B \rightarrow K^* \mu \bar \mu$ decay, to satisfy
all experimental constraints. We found the allowed region on the plane of the
dark matter and $Z'$ masses is a rather narrow compared to the previous
analysis.
