Text selection is a common and essential activity during text interaction in
all interactive systems. As Augmented Reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMDs)
become more widespread, they will need to provide effective interaction
techniques for text selection that ensure users can complete a range of text
manipulation tasks (e.g., to highlight, copy, and paste text, send instant
messages, and browse the web). As a relatively new platform, text selection in
AR is largely unexplored and the suitability of interaction techniques
supported by current AR HMDs for text selection tasks is unclear. This research
aims to fill this gap and reports on an experiment with 12 participants, which
compares the performance and usability (user experience and workload) of four
possible techniques (Hand+Pinch, Hand+Dwell, Head+Pinch, and Head+Dwell). Our
results suggest that Head+Dwell should be the default selection technique, as
it is relatively fast, has the lowest error rate and workload, and has the
highest-rated user experience and social acceptance.
