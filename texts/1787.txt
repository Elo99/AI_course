This paper considers continuous-time block-monotone Markov chains (BMMCs) and
their block-augmented truncations. We first introduce the block monotonicity
and block-wise dominance relation for continuous-time Markov chains, and then
provide some fundamental results on the two notions. Using these results, we
show that the stationary distribution vectors obtained by the block-augmented
truncation converge to the stationary distribution vector of the original BMMC.
We also show that the last-column-block-augmented truncation
(LC-block-augmented truncation) provides the best (in a certain sense)
approximation to the stationary distribution vector of a BMMC among all the
block-augmented truncations. Furthermore, we present computable upper bounds
for the total variation distance between the stationary distribution vectors of
a Markov chain and its LC-block-augmented truncation, under the assumption that
the original Markov chain itself may not be block-monotone but is block-wise
dominated by a BMMC with exponential ergodicity. Finally, we apply the obtained
bounds to a queue with a batch Markovian arrival process and state-dependent
departure rates.
