This note remarks that the correspondence between commutative non-unital
algebras and augmented unital algebras can be derived from Hovey's Smith ideal
theory. Applying Smith ideal theory of stable symmetric monoidal model
category, we formulate non-unital commutative algebra objects of stable
symmetric monoidal model categories and generalize the correspondence between
non-unital commutative algebra objects and augmented algebra objects.
