We consider a class of semi-Markov processes (SMP) such that the embedded
discrete time Markov chain may be non-homogeneous. The corresponding augmented
processes are represented as semi-martingales using stochastic integral
equation involving a Poisson random measure. The existence and uniqueness of
the equation are established. Subsequently, we show that the solution is indeed
a SMP with desired transition rate. Finally, we derive the law of the bivariate
process obtained from two solutions of the equation having two different
initial conditions.
