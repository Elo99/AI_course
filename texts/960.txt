We propose a new form for equations of state (EOS) of thermodynamic systems
in the Ising universality class. The new EOS guarantees the correct
universality and scaling behavior close to critical points and is formulated in
terms of the scaling fields only -- unlike the traditional Schofield
representation, which uses a parametric form. Close to a critical point, the
new EOS expresses the square of the strong scaling field $\Sigma$ as an
explicit function $\Sigma^2=D^{2e_{-1}}\Gamma(D^{-e_0}\Theta)$ of the thermal
scaling field $\Theta$ and the dependent scaling field $D>0$, with a smooth,
universal function $\Gamma$ and the universal exponents
$e_{-1}=\delta/(\delta+1)$, $e_0=1/(2-\alpha)$. A numerical expression for
$\Gamma$ is derived, valid close to critical points. As a consequence of the
construction it is shown that the dependent scaling field can be written as an
explicit function of the relevant scaling fields without causing strongly
singular behavior of the thermodynamic potential in the one-phase region.
Augmented by additional scaling correction fields, the new EOS also describes
the state space further away from critical points. It is indicated how to use
the new EOS to model multiphase fluid mixtures, in particular for
vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium (VLLE) where the traditional revised scaling
approach fails.
