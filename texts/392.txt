We study contextual bandit (CB) problems, where the user can sometimes
respond with the best action in a given context. Such an interaction arises,
for example, in text prediction or autocompletion settings, where a poor
suggestion is simply ignored and the user enters the desired text instead.
Crucially, this extra feedback is user-triggered on only a subset of the
contexts. We develop a new framework to leverage such signals, while being
robust to their biased nature. We also augment standard CB algorithms to
leverage the signal, and show improved regret guarantees for the resulting
algorithms under a variety of conditions on the helpfulness of and bias
inherent in this feedback.
