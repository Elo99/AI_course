Counterfactual fairness methods address the question: How would the
prediction change if the sensitive identity attributes referenced in the text
instance were different? These methods are entirely based on generating
counterfactuals for the given training and test set instances. Counterfactual
instances are commonly prepared by replacing sensitive identity terms, i.e.,
the identity terms present in the instance are replaced with other identity
terms that fall under the same sensitive category. Therefore, the efficacy of
these methods depends heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of identity
pairs. In this paper, we offer a two-step data augmentation process where (1)
the former stage consists of a novel method for preparing a comprehensive list
of identity pairs with word embeddings, and (2) the latter consists of
leveraging prepared identity pairs list to enhance the training instances by
applying three simple operations (namely identity pair replacement, identity
term blindness, and identity pair swap). We empirically show that the two-stage
augmentation process leads to diverse identity pairs and an enhanced training
set, with an improved counterfactual token-based fairness metric score on two
well-known text classification tasks.
