In recent years, the task of mining important information from social media
posts during crises has become a focus of research for the purposes of
assisting emergency response (ES). The TREC Incident Streams (IS) track is a
research challenge organised for this purpose. The track asks participating
systems to both classify a stream of crisis-related tweets into humanitarian
aid related information types and estimate their importance regarding
criticality. The former refers to a multi-label information type classification
task and the latter refers to a priority estimation task. In this paper, we
report on the participation of the University College Dublin School of Computer
Science (UCD-CS) in TREC-IS 2021. We explored a variety of approaches,
including simple machine learning algorithms, multi-task learning techniques,
text augmentation, and ensemble approaches. The official evaluation results
indicate that our runs achieve the highest scores in many metrics. To aid
reproducibility, our code is publicly available at
