This paper presents an adaptive autopilot for fixed-wing aircraft and
compares its performance with a fixed-gain autopilot. The adaptive autopilot is
constructed by augmenting the autopilot architecture with adaptive control laws
that are updated using retrospective cost adaptive control. In order to
investigate the performance of the adaptive autopilot, the default gains of the
fixed-gain autopilot are scaled to degrade its performance. This scenario
provides a venue for determining the ability of the adaptive autopilot to
compensate for the degraded fixed-gain autopilot. Next, the performance of the
adaptive autopilot is examined under failure conditions by simulating a
scenario where one of the control surfaces is assumed to be stuck at an unknown
angle. The adaptive autopilot is also tested in physical flight experiments
under degraded-nominal conditions, and the resulting performance improvement is
examined.
