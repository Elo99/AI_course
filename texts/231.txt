The rapid development of large pretrained language models has revolutionized
not only the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) but also its
evaluation. Inspired by the recent work of BARTScore: a metric leveraging the
BART language model to evaluate the quality of generated text from various
aspects, we introduce DATScore. DATScore uses data augmentation techniques to
improve the evaluation of machine translation. Our main finding is that
introducing data augmented translations of the source and reference texts is
greatly helpful in evaluating the quality of the generated translation. We also
propose two novel score averaging and term weighting strategies to improve the
original score computing process of BARTScore. Experimental results on WMT show
that DATScore correlates better with human meta-evaluations than the other
recent state-of-the-art metrics, especially for low-resource languages.
Ablation studies demonstrate the value added by our new scoring strategies.
Moreover, we report in our extended experiments the performance of DATScore on
3 NLG tasks other than translation.
