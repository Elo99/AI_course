We study in this paper the problem of adaptive trajectory tracking control
for a class of nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties. We propose to
use a modular approach, where we first design a robust nonlinear state feedback
which renders the closed loop input-to-state stable (ISS), where the input is
considered to be the estimation error of the uncertain parameters, and the
state is considered to be the closed-loop output tracking error. Next, we
augment this robust ISS controller with a model-free learning algorithm to
estimate the model uncertainties. We implement this method with two different
learning approaches. The first one is a model-free multi-parametric extremum
seeking (MES) method and the second is a Bayesian optimization-based method
called Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB). The combination of the
ISS feedback and the learning algorithms gives a learning-based modular
indirect adaptive controller. We show the efficiency of this approach on a
two-link robot manipulator example.
