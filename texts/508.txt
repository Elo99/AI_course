This survey concerns subspace recycling methods, a popular class of iterative
methods that enable effective reuse of subspace information in order to speed
up convergence and find good initial guesses over a sequence of linear systems
with slowly changing coefficient matrices, multiple right-hand sides, or both.
The subspace information that is recycled is usually generated during the run
of an iterative method (usually a Krylov subspace method) on one or more of the
systems. Following introduction of definitions and notation, we examine the
history of early augmentation schemes along with deflation preconditioning
schemes and their influence on the development of recycling methods. We then
discuss a general residual constraint framework through which many augmented
Krylov and recycling methods can both be viewed. We review several augmented
and recycling methods within this framework. We then discuss some known
effective strategies for choosing subspaces to recycle before taking the reader
through more recent developments that have generalized recycling for (sequences
of) shifted linear systems, some of them with multiple right-hand sides in
mind. We round out our survey with a brief review of application areas that
have seen benefit from subspace recycling methods.
