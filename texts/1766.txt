Metaverse seamlessly blends the physical world and virtual space via
ubiquitous communication and computing infrastructure. In transportation
systems, the vehicular Metaverse can provide a fully-immersive and hyperreal
traveling experience (e.g., via augmented reality head-up displays, AR-HUDs) to
drivers and users in autonomous vehicles (AVs) via roadside units (RSUs).
However, provisioning real-time and immersive services necessitates effective
physical-virtual synchronization between physical and virtual entities, i.e.,
AVs and Metaverse AR recommenders (MARs). In this paper, we propose a
generative AI-empowered physical-virtual synchronization framework for the
vehicular Metaverse. In physical-to-virtual synchronization, digital twin (DT)
tasks generated by AVs are offloaded for execution in RSU with future route
generation. In virtual-to-physical synchronization, MARs customize diverse and
personal AR recommendations via generative AI models based on user preferences.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to match
and price AVs and MARs for RSUs to provision real-time and effective services.
Finally, property analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed mechanism is strategy-proof and adverse-selection free while
increasing social surplus by 50%.
