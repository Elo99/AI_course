The automatic classification of applications and services is an invaluable
feature for new generation mobile networks. Here, we propose and validate
algorithms to perform this task, at runtime, from the raw physical channel of
an operative mobile network, without having to decode and/or decrypt the
transmitted flows. Towards this, we decode Downlink Control Information (DCI)
messages carried within the LTE Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH). DCI
messages are sent by the radio cell in clear text and, in this paper, are
utilized to classify the applications and services executed at the connected
mobile terminals. Two datasets are collected through a large measurement
campaign: one labeled, used to train the classification algorithms, and one
unlabeled, collected from four radio cells in the metropolitan area of
Barcelona, in Spain. Among other approaches, our Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) classifier provides the highest classification accuracy of 99%. The CNN
classifier is then augmented with the capability of rejecting sessions whose
patterns do not conform to those learned during the training phase, and is
subsequently utilized to attain a fine grained decomposition of the traffic for
the four monitored radio cells, in an online and unsupervised fashion.
