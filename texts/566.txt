Language models (LMs) pretrained on a large text corpus and fine-tuned on a
downstream text corpus and fine-tuned on a downstream task becomes a de facto
training strategy for several natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
Recently, an adaptive pretraining method retraining the pretrained language
model with task-relevant data has shown significant performance improvements.
However, current adaptive pretraining methods suffer from underfitting on the
task distribution owing to a relatively small amount of data to re-pretrain the
LM. To completely use the concept of adaptive pretraining, we propose a
back-translated task-adaptive pretraining (BT-TAPT) method that increases the
amount of task-specific data for LM re-pretraining by augmenting the task data
using back-translation to generalize the LM to the target task domain. The
experimental results show that the proposed BT-TAPT yields improved
classification accuracy on both low- and high-resource data and better
robustness to noise than the conventional adaptive pretraining method.
