Nigerian English adaptation, Pidgin, has evolved over the years through
multi-language code switching, code mixing and linguistic adaptation. While
Pidgin preserves many of the words in the normal English language corpus, both
in spelling and pronunciation, the fundamental meaning of these words have
changed significantly. For example,'ginger' is not a plant but an expression of
motivation and 'tank' is not a container but an expression of gratitude. The
implication is that the current approach of using direct English sentiment
analysis of social media text from Nigeria is sub-optimal, as it will not be
able to capture the semantic variation and contextual evolution in the
contemporary meaning of these words. In practice, while many words in Nigerian
Pidgin adaptation are the same as the standard English, the full English
language based sentiment analysis models are not designed to capture the full
intent of the Nigerian pidgin when used alone or code-mixed. By augmenting
scarce human labelled code-changed text with ample synthetic code-reformatted
text and meaning, we achieve significant improvements in sentiment scoring. Our
research explores how to understand sentiment in an intrasentential code mixing
and switching context where there has been significant word localization.This
work presents a 300 VADER lexicon compatible Nigerian Pidgin sentiment tokens
and their scores and a 14,000 gold standard Nigerian Pidgin tweets and their
sentiments labels.
