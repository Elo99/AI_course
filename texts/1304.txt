We perform knowledge distillation (KD) benchmark from task-specific BERT-base
teacher models to various student models: BiLSTM, CNN, BERT-Tiny, BERT-Mini,
and BERT-Small. Our experiment involves 12 datasets grouped in two tasks: text
classification and sequence labeling in the Indonesian language. We also
compare various aspects of distillations including the usage of word embeddings
and unlabeled data augmentation. Our experiments show that, despite the rising
popularity of Transformer-based models, using BiLSTM and CNN student models
provide the best trade-off between performance and computational resource (CPU,
RAM, and storage) compared to pruned BERT models. We further propose some quick
wins on performing KD to produce small NLP models via efficient KD training
mechanisms involving simple choices of loss functions, word embeddings, and
unlabeled data preparation.
