We present VPN - a content attribution method for recovering provenance
information from videos shared online. Platforms, and users, often transform
video into different quality, codecs, sizes, shapes, etc. or slightly edit its
content such as adding text or emoji, as they are redistributed online. We
learn a robust search embedding for matching such video, invariant to these
transformations, using full-length or truncated video queries. Once matched
against a trusted database of video clips, associated information on the
provenance of the clip is presented to the user. We use an inverted index to
match temporal chunks of video using late-fusion to combine both visual and
audio features. In both cases, features are extracted via a deep neural network
trained using contrastive learning on a dataset of original and augmented video
clips. We demonstrate high accuracy recall over a corpus of 100,000 videos.
