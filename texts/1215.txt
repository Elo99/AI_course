We present COVID-SEE, a system for medical literature discovery based on the
concept of information exploration, which builds on several distinct text
analysis and natural language processing methods to structure and organise
information in publications, and augments search by providing a visual overview
supporting exploration of a collection to identify key articles of interest. We
developed this system over COVID-19 literature to help medical professionals
and researchers explore the literature evidence, and improve findability of
relevant information. COVID-SEE is available at http://covid-see.com.
