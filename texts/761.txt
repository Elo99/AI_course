We generalize the virial theorem to the warped DGP brane world scenario and
consider its implications on the virail mass. In this theory the four
dimensional scalar curvature term is included in the bulk action and the
resulting four dimensional effective Einstein equation is augmented with extra
terms which can be interpreted as geometrical mass, contributing to the
gravitational energy. Estimating the geometrical mass using the observational
data, we show that these geometric terms may account for the virial mass
discrepancy in clusters of galaxies. Finally, we obtain the radial velocity
dispersion of galaxy clusters and show that it is compatible with the radial
velocity dispersion profle of such clusters.
