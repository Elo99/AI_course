We propose a novel monolingual sentence paraphrasing method for augmenting
the training data for statistical machine translation systems "for free" -- by
creating it from data that is already available rather than having to create
more aligned data. Starting with a syntactic tree, we recursively generate new
sentence variants where noun compounds are paraphrased using suitable
prepositions, and vice-versa -- preposition-containing noun phrases are turned
into noun compounds. The evaluation shows an improvement equivalent to 33%-50%
of that of doubling the amount of training data.
