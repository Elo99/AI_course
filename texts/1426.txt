Data augmentation is widely used as a part of the training process applied to
deep learning models, especially in the computer vision domain. Currently,
common data augmentation techniques are designed manually. Therefore they
require expert knowledge and time. Moreover, augmentations are
dataset-specific, and the optimal augmentations set on a specific dataset has
limited transferability to others. We present a simple and explainable method
called $\textbf{Safe Augmentation}$ that can learn task-specific data
augmentation techniques that do not change the data distribution and improve
the generalization of the model. We propose to use safe augmentation in two
ways: for model fine-tuning and along with other augmentation techniques. Our
method is model-agnostic, easy to implement, and achieves better accuracy on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, Tiny ImageNet, and Cityscapes datasets comparing to
baseline augmentation techniques. The code is available at
