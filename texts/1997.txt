Neural network models have demonstrated impressive performance in predicting
pathologies and outcomes from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). However,
these models often need to be trained with large, labelled datasets, which are
not available for many predictive tasks of interest. In this work, we perform
an empirical study examining whether training time data augmentation methods
can be used to improve performance on such data-scarce ECG prediction problems.
We investigate how data augmentation strategies impact model performance when
detecting cardiac abnormalities from the ECG. Motivated by our finding that the
effectiveness of existing augmentation strategies is highly task-dependent, we
introduce a new method, TaskAug, which defines a flexible augmentation policy
that is optimized on a per-task basis. We outline an efficient learning
algorithm to do so that leverages recent work in nested optimization and
implicit differentiation. In experiments, considering three datasets and eight
predictive tasks, we find that TaskAug is competitive with or improves on prior
work, and the learned policies shed light on what transformations are most
effective for different tasks. We distill key insights from our experimental
evaluation, generating a set of best practices for applying data augmentation
to ECG prediction problems.
