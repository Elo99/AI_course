This paper describes the system designed by ERNIE Team which achieved the
first place in SemEval-2020 Task 10: Emphasis Selection For Written Text in
Visual Media. Given a sentence, we are asked to find out the most important
words as the suggestion for automated design. We leverage the unsupervised
pre-training model and finetune these models on our task. After our
investigation, we found that the following models achieved an excellent
performance in this task: ERNIE 2.0, XLM-ROBERTA, ROBERTA and ALBERT. We
combine a pointwise regression loss and a pairwise ranking loss which is more
close to the final M atchm metric to finetune our models. And we also find that
additional feature engineering and data augmentation can help improve the
performance. Our best model achieves the highest score of 0.823 and ranks first
for all kinds of metrics
