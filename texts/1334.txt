In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised cancer segmentation framework for
histology images. The framework involves an effective contrastive learning
scheme for extracting distinctive visual representations for segmentation. The
encoder is a Deep U-Net (DU-Net) structure that contains an extra fully
convolution layer compared to the normal U-Net. A contrastive learning scheme
is developed to solve the problem of lacking training sets with high-quality
annotations on tumour boundaries. A specific set of data augmentation
techniques are employed to improve the discriminability of the learned colour
features from contrastive learning. Smoothing and noise elimination are
conducted using convolutional Conditional Random Fields. The experiments
demonstrate competitive performance in segmentation even better than some
popular supervised networks.
