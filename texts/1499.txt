Automated data augmentation, which aims at engineering augmentation policy
automatically, recently draw a growing research interest. Many previous
auto-augmentation methods utilized a Density Matching strategy by evaluating
policies in terms of the test-time augmentation performance. In this paper, we
theoretically and empirically demonstrated the inconsistency between the train
and validation set of small-scale medical image datasets, referred to as
in-domain sampling bias. Next, we demonstrated that the in-domain sampling bias
might cause the inefficiency of Density Matching. To address the problem, an
improved augmentation search strategy, named Augmented Density Matching, was
proposed by randomly sampling policies from a prior distribution for training.
Moreover, an efficient automatical machine learning(AutoML) algorithm was
proposed by unifying the search on data augmentation and neural architecture.
Experimental results indicated that the proposed methods outperformed
state-of-the-art approaches on MedMNIST, a pioneering benchmark designed for
AutoML in medical image analysis.
