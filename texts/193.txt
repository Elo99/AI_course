Channel puncturing transforms a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel
into a sparse lower-triangular form using the so-called WL decomposition scheme
in order to reduce tree-based detection complexity. We propose computationally
efficient soft-output detectors based on two forms of channel puncturing:
augmented and two-sided. The augmented WL detector (AWLD) employs a punctured
channel derived by triangularizing the true channel in augmented form, followed
by leftsided Gaussian elimination. The two-sided WL detector (dubbed WLZ)
employs right-sided reduction and left-sided elimination to puncture the
channel. We prove that augmented channel puncturing is optimal in maximizing
the lower-bound on the achievable information rate (AIR) based on a new
mismatched detection model. We show that the AWLD decomposes into an MMSE
prefilter and channel gain compensation stages, followed by a regular WL
detector (WLD) that computes least-squares softdecision estimates. Similarly,
WLZ decomposes into a pre-processing reduction step followed by WLD. AWLD
attains the same performance as the existing AIR-based partial marginalization
(PM) detector, but with less computational complexity. We empirically show that
WLZ attains the best complexityperformance tradeoff among tree-based detectors.
