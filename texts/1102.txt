Non-Abelian Vector Boson Dark Matter (VBDM), arising from an $SU(2)_N$
extension of the Standard Model (SM) has been studied. The Dark Matter (DM) is
stabilized by imposing an additional discrete global symmetry $S^{'}$ with
charges, such that it satisfies $S=S^{'}+T_{3N}$ even when $SU(2)_N$ is
completely broken. This model, apart from a single-component DM also offers a
two-component DM augmented by a scalar and a vector boson, which lives over a
large parameter space evading strong direct search bounds. Apart from potential
DM candidates, this model also explains the smallness of neutrino masses
through the $inverse$ $seesaw$ $mechanism$. We have computed tree-unitarity
bound to limit the scalar mass spectrum in our model. Phenomenological aspects
of the model have been discussed. Further, we have analyzed the possible
collider signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its future
implications.
