Integrating human feedback in models can improve the performance of natural
language processing (NLP) models. Feedback can be either explicit (e.g. ranking
used in training language models) or implicit (e.g. using human cognitive
signals in the form of eyetracking). Prior eye tracking and NLP research reveal
that cognitive processes, such as human scanpaths, gleaned from human gaze
patterns aid in the understanding and performance of NLP models. However, the
collection of real eyetracking data for NLP tasks is challenging due to the
requirement of expensive and precise equipment coupled with privacy invasion
issues. To address this challenge, we propose ScanTextGAN, a novel model for
generating human scanpaths over text. We show that ScanTextGAN-generated
scanpaths can approximate meaningful cognitive signals in human gaze patterns.
We include synthetically generated scanpaths in four popular NLP tasks spanning
six different datasets as proof of concept and show that the models augmented
with generated scanpaths improve the performance of all downstream NLP tasks.
