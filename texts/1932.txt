The study examines the problem of using augmented and virtual reality in the
process of blended learning in general secondary education. The study analyzes
the meaning of the concept of "blended learning". The conceptual principles of
blended learning are considered. The definition of augmented and virtual
reality is given. The mixed reality is considered as a separate kind of notion.
Separate applications of virtual and augmented reality that can be used in the
process of blended learning are considered. As a result of the study, the
authors propose possible ways to use augmented reality in the educational
process. The model of using augmented and virtual reality in blended learning
in general secondary education institutions was designed. It consists of the
following blocks: goal; teacher's activity; forms of education; teaching
methods; teaching aids; organizational forms of education; pupil activity and
results. Based on the model, the methodology of using augmented and virtual
reality in blended learning in general secondary education was developed. The
methodology contains the following components: target component, content
component, technological component and resultant component. The methodology is
quite universal and can be used for any subject in general secondary education.
The types of lessons in which it is expedient to use augmented (AR) and virtual
reality(VR) are determined. Recommendations are given at which stage of the
lesson it is better to use AR and VR tools (depending on the type of lesson).
