Unsupervised attributed graph representation learning is challenging since
both structural and feature information are required to be represented in the
latent space. Existing methods concentrate on learning latent representation
via reconstruction tasks, but cannot directly optimize representation and are
prone to oversmoothing, thus limiting the applications on downstream tasks. To
alleviate these issues, we propose a novel graph embedding framework named Deep
Manifold Attributed Graph Embedding (DMAGE). A node-to-node geodesic similarity
is proposed to compute the inter-node similarity between the data space and the
latent space and then use Bergman divergence as loss function to minimize the
difference between them. We then design a new network structure with fewer
aggregation to alleviate the oversmoothing problem and incorporate graph
structure augmentation to improve the representation's stability. Our proposed
DMAGE surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on three
downstream tasks: unsupervised visualization, node clustering, and link
prediction across four popular datasets.
