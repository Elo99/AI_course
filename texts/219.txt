Is it possible to leverage large scale raw and raw parallel corpora to build
a general learned metric? Existing learned metrics have gaps to human
judgements, are model-dependent or are limited to the domains or tasks where
human ratings are available. In this paper, we propose SEScore2, a model-based
metric pretrained over million-scale synthetic dataset constructed by our novel
retrieval augmented data synthesis pipeline. SEScore2 achieves high correlation
to human judgements without any human rating supervisions. Importantly, our
unsupervised SEScore2 can outperform supervised metrics, which are trained on
the News human ratings, at the TED domain. We evaluate SEScore2 over four text
generation tasks across three languages. SEScore2 outperforms all prior
unsupervised evaluation metrics in machine translation, speech translation,
data-to-text and dialogue generation, with average Kendall improvements 0.158.
SEScore2 even outperforms SOTA supervised BLEURT at data-to-text, dialogue
generation and overall correlation.
