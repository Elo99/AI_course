Despite profound successes, contrastive representation learning relies on
carefully designed data augmentations using domain specific knowledge. This
challenge is magnified in natural language processing where no general rules
exist for data augmentation due to the discrete nature of natural language. We
tackle this challenge by presenting a Virtual augmentation Supported
Contrastive Learning of sentence representations (VaSCL). Originating from the
interpretation that data augmentation essentially constructs the neighborhoods
of each training instance, we in turn utilize the neighborhood to generate
effective data augmentations. Leveraging the large training batch size of
contrastive learning, we approximate the neighborhood of an instance via its
K-nearest in-batch neighbors in the representation space. We then define an
instance discrimination task regarding this neighborhood and generate the
virtual augmentation in an adversarial training manner. We access the
performance of VaSCL on a wide range of downstream tasks, and set a new
state-of-the-art for unsupervised sentence representation learning.
