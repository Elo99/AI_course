Imbalanced data commonly exists in real world, espacially in
sentiment-related corpus, making it difficult to train a classifier to
distinguish latent sentiment in text data. We observe that humans often express
transitional emotion between two adjacent discourses with discourse markers
like "but", "though", "while", etc, and the head discourse and the tail
discourse 3 usually indicate opposite emotional tendencies. Based on this
observation, we propose a novel plug-and-play method, which first samples
discourses according to transitional discourse markers and then validates
sentimental polarities with the help of a pretrained attention-based model. Our
method increases sample diversity in the first place, can serve as a upstream
preprocessing part in data augmentation. We conduct experiments on three public
sentiment datasets, with several frequently used algorithms. Results show that
our method is found to be consistently effective, even in highly imbalanced
scenario, and easily be integrated with oversampling method to boost the
performance on imbalanced sentiment classification.
