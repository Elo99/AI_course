This paper presents a solution to the GenChal 2022 shared task dedicated to
feedback comment generation for writing learning. In terms of this task given a
text with an error and a span of the error, a system generates an explanatory
note that helps the writer (language learner) to improve their writing skills.
Our solution is based on fine-tuning the T5 model on the initial dataset
augmented according to syntactical dependencies of the words located within
indicated error span. The solution of our team "nigula" obtained second place
according to manual evaluation by the organizers.
