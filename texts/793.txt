Scene text detection based on deep neural networks have progressed
substantially over the past years. However, previous state-of-the-art methods
may still fall short when dealing with challenging public benchmarks because
the performances of algorithm are determined by the robust features extraction
and components in network architecture. To address this issue, we will present
a network architecture derived from the loss to maximize conditional
log-likelihood by optimizing the lower bound with a proper approximate
posterior that has shown impressive performance in several generative models.
In addition, by extending the layer of latent variables to multiple layers, the
network is able to learn robust features on scale with no task-specific
regularization or data augmentation. We provide a detailed analysis and show
the results on three public benchmark datasets to confirm the efficiency and
reliability of the proposed algorithm. In experiments, the proposed algorithm
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recall and
precision. Specifically, it achieves an H-mean of 95.12 and 96.78 on ICDAR 2011
and ICDAR 2013, respectively.
