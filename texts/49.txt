This paper presents a new data augmentation algorithm for natural
understanding tasks, called RPN:Random Position Noise algorithm.Due to the
relative paucity of current text augmentation methods. Few of the extant
methods apply to natural language understanding tasks for all sentence-level
tasks.RPN applies the traditional augmentation on the original text to the word
vector level. The RPN algorithm makes a substitution in one or several
dimensions of some word vectors. As a result, the RPN can introduce a certain
degree of perturbation to the sample and can adjust the range of perturbation
on different tasks. The augmented samples are then used to give the model
training.This makes the model more robust. In subsequent experiments, we found
that adding RPN to the training or fine-tuning model resulted in a stable boost
on all 8 natural language processing tasks, including TweetEval, CoLA, and
SST-2 datasets, and more significant improvements than other data augmentation
algorithms.The RPN algorithm applies to all sentence-level tasks for language
understanding and is used in any deep learning model with a word embedding
layer.
