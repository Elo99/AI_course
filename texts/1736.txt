This paper mainly describes our winning solution (team name: www) to Amazon
ESCI Challenge of KDD CUP 2022, which achieves a NDCG score of 0.9043 and wins
the first place on task 1: the query-product ranking track.
  In this competition, participants are provided with a real-world large-scale
multilingual shopping queries data set and it contains query-product pairs in
English, Japanese and Spanish. Three different tasks are proposed in this
competition, including ranking the results list as task 1, classifying the
query/product pairs into Exact, Substitute, Complement, or Irrelevant (ESCI)
categories as task 2 and identifying substitute products for a given query as
task 3.
  We mainly focus on task 1 and propose a semantic alignment system for
multilingual query-product retrieval. Pre-trained multilingual language models
(LM) are adopted to get the semantic representation of queries and products.
Our models are all trained with cross-entropy loss to classify the
query-product pairs into ESCI 4 categories at first, and then we use weighted
sum with the 4-class probabilities to get the score for ranking. To further
boost the model, we also do elaborative data preprocessing, data augmentation
by translation, specially handling English texts with English LMs, adversarial
training with AWP and FGM, self distillation, pseudo labeling, label smoothing
and ensemble. Finally, Our solution outperforms others both on public and
private leaderboard.
