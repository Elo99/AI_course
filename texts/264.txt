In this paper, we introduced a dynamic Gordon growth model, which is
augmented by Bayesian Markov--Switching Vector Autoregressive (MS--BVAR)
process. Using the risk--neutral valuation method and locally risk--minimizing
strategy, we obtained pricing and hedging formulas for the dividend--paying
European call and put options, Margrabe option, segregated fund, and
unit--linked life insurance. It is assumed that the regime--switching process
is generated by a homogeneous Markov process and the residual process follows a
heteroscedastic model.
