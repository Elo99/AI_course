In this paper, we focus on improving the performance of the text-dependent
speaker verification system in the scenario of limited training data. The
speaker verification system deep learning based text-dependent generally needs
a large scale text-dependent training data set which could be labor and cost
expensive, especially for customized new wake-up words. In recent studies,
voice conversion systems that can generate high quality synthesized speech of
seen and unseen speakers have been proposed. Inspired by those works, we adopt
two different voice conversion methods as well as the very simple re-sampling
approach to generate new text-dependent speech samples for data augmentation
purposes. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly
improves the Equal Error Rare performance from 6.51% to 4.51% in the scenario
of limited training data.
