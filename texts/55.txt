Data augmentation is commonly used for generating additional data from the
available training data to achieve a robust estimation of the parameters of
complex models like the one for speaker verification (SV), especially for
under-resourced applications. SV involves training speaker-independent (SI)
models and speaker-dependent models where speakers are represented by models
derived from an SI model using the training data for the particular speaker
during the enrollment phase. While data augmentation for training SI models is
well studied, data augmentation for speaker enrollment is rarely explored. In
this paper, we propose the use of data augmentation methods for generating
extra data to empower speaker enrollment. Each data augmentation method
generates a new data set. Two strategies of using the data sets are explored:
the first one is to training separate systems and fuses them at the score level
and the other is to conduct multi-conditional training. Furthermore, we study
the effect of data augmentation under noisy conditions. Experiments are
performed on RedDots challenge 2016 database, and the results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.
