In earlier work, a decentralized optimal control framework was established
for coordinating online connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in merging
roadways, urban intersections, speed reduction zones, and roundabouts. The
dynamics of each vehicle were represented by a double integrator and the
Hamiltonian analysis was applied to derive an analytical solution that
minimizes the L2-norm of the control input. However, the analytical solution
did not consider the rear-end collision avoidance constraint. In this paper, we
derive a complete, closed-form analytical solution that includes the rear-end
safety constraint in addition to the state and control constraints. We augment
the double integrator model that represents a vehicle with an additional state
corresponding to the distance from its preceding vehicle. Thus, the rear-end
collision avoidance constraint is included as a state constraint. The
effectiveness of the solution is illustrated through simulation.
