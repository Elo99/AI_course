Covid-19 detection at an early stage can aid in an effective treatment and
isolation plan to prevent its spread. Recently, transfer learning has been used
for Covid-19 detection using X-ray, ultrasound, and CT scans. One of the major
limitations inherent to these proposed methods is limited labeled dataset size
that affects the reliability of Covid-19 diagnosis and disease progression. In
this work, we demonstrate that how we can augment limited X-ray images data by
using Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to train the
last layer of the pre-trained deep learning models to mitigate the bias of
transfer learning for Covid-19 detection. We transfer learned various
pre-trained deep learning models including AlexNet, ZFNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18,
and GoogLeNet, and fine-tune the last layer by using CLAHE-augmented dataset.
The experiment results reveal that the CLAHE-based augmentation to various
pre-trained deep learning models significantly improves the model efficiency.
The pre-trained VCG-16 model with CLAHEbased augmented images achieves a
sensitivity of 95% using 15 epochs. AlexNet works show good sensitivity when
trained on non-augmented data. Other models demonstrate a value of less than
60% when trained on non-augmented data. Our results reveal that the sample bias
can negatively impact the performance of transfer learning which is
significantly improved by using CLAHE-based augmentation.
