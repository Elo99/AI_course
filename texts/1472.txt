There is a common belief that the successful training of deep neural networks
requires many annotated training samples, which are often expensive and
difficult to obtain especially in the biomedical imaging field. While it is
often easy for researchers to use data augmentation to expand the size of
training sets, constructing and generating generic augmented data that is able
to teach the network the desired invariance and robustness properties using
traditional data augmentation techniques is challenging in practice. In this
paper, we propose a novel automatic data augmentation method that uses
generative adversarial networks to learn augmentations that enable machine
learning based method to learn the available annotated samples more
efficiently. The architecture consists of a coarse-to-fine generator to capture
the manifold of the training sets and generate generic augmented data. In our
experiments, we show the efficacy of our approach on a Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) image, achieving improvements of 3.5% Dice coefficient on the
BRATS15 Challenge dataset as compared to traditional augmentation approaches.
Also, our proposed method successfully boosts a common segmentation network to
reach the state-of-the-art performance on the BRATS15 Challenge.
