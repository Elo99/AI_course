Esports, a sports competition using video games, has become one of the most
important sporting events in recent years. Although the amount of esports data
is increasing than ever, only a small fraction of those data accompanies text
commentaries for the audience to retrieve and understand the plays. Therefore,
in this study, we introduce a task of generating game commentaries from
structured data records to address the problem. We first build a large-scale
esports data-to-text dataset using structured data and commentaries from a
popular esports game, League of Legends. On this dataset, we devise several
data preprocessing methods including linearization and data splitting to
augment its quality. We then introduce several baseline encoder-decoder models
and propose a hierarchical model to generate game commentaries. Considering the
characteristics of esports commentaries, we design evaluation metrics including
three aspects of the output: correctness, fluency, and strategic depth.
Experimental results on our large-scale esports dataset confirmed the advantage
of the hierarchical model, and the results revealed several challenges of this
novel task.
