Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the drug
discovery process, offering improved efficiency, accuracy, and speed. However,
the successful application of AI is dependent on the availability of
high-quality data, the addressing of ethical concerns, and the recognition of
the limitations of AI-based approaches. In this article, the benefits,
challenges and drawbacks of AI in this field are reviewed, and possible
strategies and approaches for overcoming the present obstacles are proposed.
The use of data augmentation, explainable AI, and the integration of AI with
traditional experimental methods, as well as the potential advantages of AI in
pharmaceutical research are also discussed. Overall, this review highlights the
potential of AI in drug discovery and provides insights into the challenges and
opportunities for realizing its potential in this field.
  Note from the human-authors: This article was created to test the ability of
ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3.5 language model, to assist human authors
in writing review articles. The text generated by the AI following our
instructions (see Supporting Information) was used as a starting point, and its
ability to automatically generate content was evaluated. After conducting a
thorough review, human authors practically rewrote the manuscript, striving to
maintain a balance between the original proposal and scientific criteria. The
advantages and limitations of using AI for this purpose are discussed in the
last section.
