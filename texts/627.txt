Legal argumentation is a vital cornerstone of justice, underpinning an
adversarial form of law, and extensive research has attempted to augment or
undertake legal argumentation via the use of computer-based automation
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) have especially furthered the
capabilities of leveraging AI for aiding legal professionals, doing so in ways
that are modeled here as CARE, namely Crafting, Assessing, Refining, and
Engaging in legal argumentation. In addition to AI-enabled legal argumentation
serving to augment human-based lawyering, an aspirational goal of this
multi-disciplinary field consists of ultimately achieving autonomously effected
human-equivalent legal argumentation. As such, an innovative meta-approach is
proposed to apply the Levels of Autonomy (LoA) of AI Legal Reasoning (AILR) to
the maturation of AI and Legal Argumentation (AILA), proffering a new means of
gauging progress in this ever-evolving and rigorously sought domain.
