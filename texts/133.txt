We present semi-supervised models with data augmentation (SMDA), a
semi-supervised text classification system to classify interactive affective
responses. SMDA utilizes recent transformer-based models to encode each
sentence and employs back translation techniques to paraphrase given sentences
as augmented data. For labeled sentences, we performed data augmentations to
uniform the label distributions and computed supervised loss during training
process. For unlabeled sentences, we explored self-training by regarding
low-entropy predictions over unlabeled sentences as pseudo labels, assuming
high-confidence predictions as labeled data for training. We further introduced
consistency regularization as unsupervised loss after data augmentations on
unlabeled data, based on the assumption that the model should predict similar
class distributions with original unlabeled sentences as input and augmented
sentences as input. Via a set of experiments, we demonstrated that our system
outperformed baseline models in terms of F1-score and accuracy.
