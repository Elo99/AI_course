The timely delivery of resource-intensive and latency-sensitive services
(e.g., industrial automation, augmented reality) over distributed computing
networks (e.g., mobile edge computing) is drawing increasing attention.
Motivated by the insufficiency of average delay performance guarantees provided
by existing studies, we focus on the critical goal of delivering next
generation real-time services ahead of corresponding deadlines on a per-packet
basis, while minimizing overall cloud network resource cost. We introduce a
novel queuing system that is able to track data packets' lifetime and formalize
the optimal cloud network control problem with strict deadline constraints.
After illustrating the main challenges in delivering packets to their
destinations before getting dropped due to lifetime expiry, we construct an
equivalent formulation, where relaxed flow conservation allows leveraging
Lyapunov optimization to derive a provably near-optimal fully distributed
algorithm for the original problem. Numerical results validate the theoretical
analysis and show the superior performance of the proposed control policy
compared with state-of-the-art cloud network control.
