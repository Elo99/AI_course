Recent progress in deep learning has led to the development of Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) systems which perform remarkably well. Most
research has been around recurrent networks as well as complex gated layers
which make the overall solution complex and difficult to scale. In this paper,
we present an Efficient And Scalable TExt Recognizer (EASTER) to perform
optical character recognition on both machine printed and handwritten text. Our
model utilises 1-D convolutional layers without any recurrence which enables
parallel training with considerably less volume of data. We experimented with
multiple variations of our architecture and one of the smallest variant (depth
and number of parameter wise) performs comparably to RNN based complex choices.
Our 20-layered deepest variant outperforms RNN architectures with a good margin
on benchmarking datasets like IIIT-5k and SVT. We also showcase improvements
over the current best results on offline handwritten text recognition task. We
also present data generation pipelines with augmentation setup to generate
synthetic datasets for both handwritten and machine printed text.
