Multistage ranking models, including the popular Plackett-Luce distribution
(PL), rely on the assumption that the ranking process is performed
sequentially, by assigning the positions from the top to the bottom one
(forward order). A recent contribution to the ranking literature relaxed this
assumption with the addition of the discrete-valued reference order parameter,
yielding the novel Extended Plackett-Luce model (EPL). Inference on the EPL and
its generalization into a finite mixture framework was originally addressed
from the frequentist perspective. In this work, we propose the Bayesian
estimation of the EPL with order constraints on the reference order parameter.
The proposed restrictions reflect a meaningful rank assignment process. By
combining the restrictions with the data augmentation strategy and the
conjugacy of the Gamma prior distribution with the EPL, we facilitate the
construction of a tuned joint Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within Gibbs
sampling to simulate from the posterior distribution. The Bayesian approach
allows to address more efficiently the inference on the additional
discrete-valued parameter and the assessment of its estimation uncertainty. The
usefulness of the proposal is illustrated with applications to simulated and
real datasets.
