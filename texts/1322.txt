Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been shown to achieve remarkable results
in multiple fields. Due to the nature of the immersive medium of Virtual
Reality it logically follows that it can be used as a high-quality educational
tool as it offers potentially a higher bandwidth than other mediums such as
text, pictures and videos. This short paper illustrates the development of a
climate change educational awareness application for virtual reality to
simulate virtual scenes of local scenery and sea level rising until 2100 using
prediction data. The paper also reports on the current in progress work of
porting the system to Augmented Reality (AR) and future work to evaluate the
system.
