We propose a novel framework to evaluate the robustness of transformer-based
form field extraction methods via form attacks. We introduce 14 novel form
transformations to evaluate the vulnerability of the state-of-the-art field
extractors against form attacks from both OCR level and form level, including
OCR location/order rearrangement, form background manipulation and form
field-value augmentation. We conduct robustness evaluation using real invoices
and receipts, and perform comprehensive research analysis. Experimental results
suggest that the evaluated models are very susceptible to form perturbations
such as the variation of field-values (~15% drop in F1 score), the
disarrangement of input text order(~15% drop in F1 score) and the disruption of
the neighboring words of field-values(~10% drop in F1 score). Guided by the
analysis, we make recommendations to improve the design of field extractors and
the process of data collection.
