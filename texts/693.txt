We propose a minimal extention of the Standard Model where neutrino masses
are generated radiatively at one-loop level via Scotogenic scanario. The model
is augmented with $A_4$ modular symmetry as a scotogenic and flavor symmetry.
With minimal number of parameters, the model makes predictions for neutrino
oscillation data, Majorana and Dirac phases, dark matter characteristics, and
neutrinoless double beta decay.
