Augmenting the body with artificial limbs controlled concurrently to the
natural limbs has long appeared in science fiction, but recent technological
and neuroscientific advances have begun to make this vision possible. By
allowing individuals to achieve otherwise impossible actions, this movement
augmentation could revolutionize medical and industrial applications and
profoundly change the way humans interact with their environment. Here, we
construct a movement augmentation taxonomy through what is augmented and how it
is achieved. With this framework, we analyze augmentation that extends the
number of degrees-of-freedom, discuss critical features of effective
augmentation such as physiological control signals, sensory feedback and
learning, and propose a vision for the field.
