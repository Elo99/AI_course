Contrastive learning methods achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
sentence representation learning. Although playing essential roles in
contrastive learning, data augmentation methods applied on sentences have not
been fully explored. Current SOTA method SimCSE utilizes a simple dropout
mechanism as continuous augmentation which outperforms discrete augmentations
such as cropping, word deletion and synonym replacement. To understand the
underlying rationales, we revisit existing approaches and attempt to
hypothesize the desiderata of reasonable data augmentation methods: balance of
semantic consistency and expression diversity. Based on the hypothesis, we
propose three simple yet effective discrete sentence augmentation methods,
i.e., punctuation insertion, affirmative auxiliary and double negation. The
punctuation marks, auxiliaries and negative words act as minimal noises in
lexical level to produce diverse sentence expressions. Unlike traditional
augmentation methods which randomly modify the sentence, our augmentation rules
are well designed for generating semantically consistent and grammatically
correct sentences. We conduct extensive experiments on both English and Chinese
semantic textual similarity datasets. The results show the robustness and
effectiveness of the proposed methods.
