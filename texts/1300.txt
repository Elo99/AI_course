In this article we give strong versions for preparation theorems for
$\mathbb{R}_{an,exp}$-definable functions outgoing from methods of Lion and
Rolin ($\mathbb{R}_{an,exp}$ is the o-minimal structure generated by all
restricted analytic functions and the global exponential function). By a deep
model theoretic fact of Van den Dries, Macintyre and Marker every
$\mathbb{R}_{an,exp}$-definable function is piecewise given by
$\mathcal{L}_{an}(\exp,\log)$-terms where $\mathcal{L}_{an}(\exp,\log)$ denotes
the language of ordered rings augmented by all restricted analytic functions,
the global exponential and the global logarithm. The idea is to consider
log-analytic functions at first, i.e. functions which are iterated compositions
from either side of globally subanalytic functions and the global logarithm,
and then $\mathbb{R}_{an,exp}$-definable functions as compositions of
log-analytic functions and the global exponential.
