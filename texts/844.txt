Subjective answer evaluation is a time-consuming and tedious task, and the
quality of the evaluation is heavily influenced by a variety of subjective
personal characteristics. Instead, machine evaluation can effectively assist
educators in saving time while also ensuring that evaluations are fair and
realistic. However, most existing methods using regular machine learning and
natural language processing techniques are generally hampered by a lack of
annotated answers and poor model interpretability, making them unsuitable for
real-world use. To solve these challenges, we propose ProtSi Network, a unique
semi-supervised architecture that for the first time uses few-shot learning to
subjective answer evaluation. To evaluate students' answers by similarity
prototypes, ProtSi Network simulates the natural process of evaluator scoring
answers by combining Siamese Network which consists of BERT and encoder layers
with Prototypical Network. We employed an unsupervised diverse paraphrasing
model ProtAugment, in order to prevent overfitting for effective few-shot text
classification. By integrating contrastive learning, the discriminative text
issue can be mitigated. Experiments on the Kaggle Short Scoring Dataset
demonstrate that the ProtSi Network outperforms the most recent baseline models
in terms of accuracy and quadratic weighted kappa.
