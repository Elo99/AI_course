We propose self-training with noisy student-teacher approach for streaming
keyword spotting, that can utilize large-scale unlabeled data and aggressive
data augmentation. The proposed method applies aggressive data augmentation
(spectral augmentation) on the input of both student and teacher and utilize
unlabeled data at scale, which significantly boosts the accuracy of student
against challenging conditions. Such aggressive augmentation usually degrades
model performance when used with supervised training with hard-labeled data.
Experiments show that aggressive spec augmentation on baseline supervised
training method degrades accuracy, while the proposed self-training with noisy
student-teacher training improves accuracy of some difficult-conditioned test
sets by as much as 60%.
