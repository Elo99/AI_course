This paper describes the system developed at the Universitat Polit\`ecnica de
Catalunya for the Workshop on Machine Translation 2022 Sign Language
Translation Task, in particular, for the sign-to-text direction. We use a
Transformer model implemented with the Fairseq modeling toolkit. We have
experimented with the vocabulary size, data augmentation techniques and
pretraining the model with the PHOENIX-14T dataset. Our system obtains 0.50
BLEU score for the test set, improving the organizers' baseline by 0.38 BLEU.
We remark the poor results for both the baseline and our system, and thus, the
unreliability of our findings.
