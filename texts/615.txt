Anomaly detection is the process of finding data points that deviate from a
baseline. In a real-life setting, anomalies are usually unknown or extremely
rare. Moreover, the detection must be accomplished in a timely manner or the
risk of corrupting the system might grow exponentially. In this work, we
propose a two level framework for detecting anomalies in sequences of discrete
elements. First, we assess whether we can obtain enough information from the
statistics collected from the discriminator's layers to discriminate between
out of distribution and in distribution samples. We then build an unsupervised
anomaly detection module based on these statistics. As to augment the data and
keep track of classes of known data, we lean toward a semi-supervised
adversarial learning applied to discrete elements.
