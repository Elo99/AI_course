Government-sponsored policy-making and scheme generations is one of the means
of protecting and promoting the social, economic, and personal development of
the citizens. The evaluation of effectiveness of these schemes done by
government only provide the statistical information in terms of facts and
figures which do not include the in-depth knowledge of public perceptions,
experiences and views on the topic. In this research work, we propose an
improved text classification framework that classifies the Twitter data of
different health-based government schemes. The proposed framework leverages the
language representation models (LR models) BERT, ELMO, and USE. However, these
LR models have less real-time applicability due to the scarcity of the ample
annotated data. To handle this, we propose a novel GloVe word embeddings and
class-specific sentiments based text augmentation approach (named Mod-EDA)
which boosts the performance of text classification task by increasing the size
of labeled data. Furthermore, the trained model is leveraged to identify the
level of engagement of citizens towards these policies in different communities
such as middle-income and low-income groups.
