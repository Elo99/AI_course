Data from the CPLEAR collaboration coupled with the assumption that the
Bell-Steinberger relation holds have provided {\em direct} evidence for
\ot~violation. In this note we investigate what we can say about \ot~violation
{\em without} such an assumption.
  We show that both the modulus and the phase of $\eta_{+-}$ can be reproduced
with \ot~{\em invariant} dynamics through finetuning \cpt~breaking. The large
\ot~odd correlation observed by the KTeV collaboration in $K_L \to \pi ^+\pi ^-
e^+ e^-$ thus does not yield direct evidence for \ot~violation. In such a world
the phase of $\frac{\epsilon'}{\epsilon}$ is $\delta_2-\delta_0-\phi_{SW}\sim
-(85.5\pm 4)^\circ$. Also, $K^{\pm} \to \pi ^{\pm} \pi ^0$ could exhibit a
\cpt~asymmetry of up to few$\times 10^{-3}$ without upsetting any known bound.
