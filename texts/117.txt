This study discusses the effect of semi-supervised learning in combination
with pretrained language models for data-to-text generation. It is not known
whether semi-supervised learning is still helpful when a large-scale language
model is also supplemented. This study aims to answer this question by
comparing a data-to-text system only supplemented with a language model, to two
data-to-text systems that are additionally enriched by a data augmentation or a
pseudo-labeling semi-supervised learning approach.
  Results show that semi-supervised learning results in higher scores on
diversity metrics. In terms of output quality, extending the training set of a
data-to-text system with a language model using the pseudo-labeling approach
did increase text quality scores, but the data augmentation approach yielded
similar scores to the system without training set extension. These results
indicate that semi-supervised learning approaches can bolster output quality
and diversity, even when a language model is also present.
