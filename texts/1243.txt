The Muon g-2 experiment at FERMILAB has confirmed the muon anomalous magnetic
moment anomaly with an error bar 15% smaller and a different central value
compared with the previous Brookhaven result. The combined results from
FERMILAB and Brookhaven show a difference with theory at a significance of
$4.2\sigma$, strongly indicating the presence of new physics. In light of this
new result, we discuss a Two Higgs Doublet model augmented by an Abelian gauge
symmetry that can simultaneously accommodate a light dark matter candidate and
$(g-2)_\mu$, in agreement with existing bounds.
