Frank Wilczek's essay "Total Relativity: Mach 2004" (PHYSICS TODAY April,
2004, p. 10) cogently updates the status of the intuitively compelling, but
partly unrealized, theory of Mach's Principle. I think, however, that an
important consequence of the Principle has been skipped: that is, the
possibility of linear deformations of the internal structure of elementary
particles from the Minkowski structure imposed by the local gravitational
(metric) field. [Note: This Comment is similar to one submitted to, but not
published by, PHYSICS TODAY as a Letter to the Editor.]
