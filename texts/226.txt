Extracting cybersecurity entities such as attackers and vulnerabilities from
unstructured network texts is an important part of security analysis. However,
the sparsity of intelligence data resulted from the higher frequency variations
and the randomness of cybersecurity entity names makes it difficult for current
methods to perform well in extracting security-related concepts and entities.
To this end, we propose a semantic augmentation method which incorporates
different linguistic features to enrich the representation of input tokens to
detect and classify the cybersecurity names over unstructured text. In
particular, we encode and aggregate the constituent feature, morphological
feature and part of speech feature for each input token to improve the
robustness of the method. More than that, a token gets augmented semantic
information from its most similar K words in cybersecurity domain corpus where
an attentive module is leveraged to weigh differences of the words, and from
contextual clues based on a large-scale general field corpus. We have conducted
experiments on the cybersecurity datasets DNRTI and MalwareTextDB, and the
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
