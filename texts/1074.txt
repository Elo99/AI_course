This paper proposes a new distributed control architecture for distributed
generation units in heterogeneous DC islanded microgrids. Each unit is equipped
with state-feedback baseline and augmenting $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive voltage
controllers at the primary level of the microgrid control hierarchy. Local
controller synthesis is scalable as it only requires information about
corresponding units, couplings, and at most, the addition of state-predictor
measurements of neighbouring controllers. Global asymptotic stability of the
microgrid is guaranteed in a plug-and-play fashion by exploiting Lyapunov
functions and algebraic Riccati equations. The performance of the proposed
architecture is evaluated using a heterogeneous DC islanded microgrid that
consists of 6 DC-DC boost converters configured in a radial and meshed
topology. The use of $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controllers achieves fast and
robust microgrid voltage stability in the presence of plug-and-play operations,
topology changes and unknown load changes. Finally, the distributed
architecture is tested on a bus-connected islanded-microgrid consisting of
linear resistive load and non-linear DC motor.
