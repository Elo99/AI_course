Activation functions play an important role in training artificial neural
networks. The majority of currently used activation functions are deterministic
in nature, with their fixed input-output relationship. In this work, we propose
a novel probabilistic activation function, called ProbAct. ProbAct is
decomposed into a mean and variance and the output value is sampled from the
formed distribution, making ProbAct a stochastic activation function. The
values of mean and variances can be fixed using known functions or trained for
each element. In the trainable ProbAct, the mean and the variance of the
activation distribution is trained within the back-propagation framework
alongside other parameters. We show that the stochastic perturbation induced
through ProbAct acts as a viable generalization technique for feature
augmentation. In our experiments, we compare ProbAct with well-known activation
functions on classification tasks on different modalities: Images(CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and STL-10) and Text (Large Movie Review). We show that ProbAct
increases the classification accuracy by +2-3% compared to ReLU or other
conventional activation functions on both original datasets and when datasets
are reduced to 50% and 25% of the original size. Finally, we show that ProbAct
learns an ensemble of models by itself that can be used to estimate the
uncertainties associated with the prediction and provides robustness to noisy
inputs.
