Lexical substitution, i.e. generation of plausible words that can replace a
particular target word in a given context, is an extremely powerful technology
that can be used as a backbone of various NLP applications, including word
sense induction and disambiguation, lexical relation extraction, data
augmentation, etc. In this paper, we present a large-scale comparative study of
lexical substitution methods employing both rather old and most recent language
and masked language models (LMs and MLMs), such as context2vec, ELMo, BERT,
RoBERTa, XLNet. We show that already competitive results achieved by SOTA
LMs/MLMs can be further substantially improved if information about the target
word is injected properly. Several existing and new target word injection
methods are compared for each LM/MLM using both intrinsic evaluation on lexical
substitution datasets and extrinsic evaluation on word sense induction (WSI)
datasets. On two WSI datasets we obtain new SOTA results. Besides, we analyze
the types of semantic relations between target words and their substitutes
generated by different models or given by annotators.
