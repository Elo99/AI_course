Technology for open-ended language generation, a key application of
artificial intelligence, has advanced to a great extent in recent years.
Large-scale language models, which are trained on large corpora of text, are
being used in a wide range of applications everywhere, from virtual assistants
to conversational bots. While these language models output fluent text,
existing research shows that these models can and do capture human biases. Many
of these biases, especially those that could potentially cause harm, are being
well investigated. On the other hand, studies that infer and change personality
traits inherited by these models have been scarce or non-existent. In this
work, we explore the personality traits of several large-scale language models
designed for open-ended text generation and the datasets used for training
them. Our work builds on the popular Big Five factors and develops robust
methods that quantify the personality traits of these models and their
underlying datasets. In particular, we trigger the models with a questionnaire
designed for personality assessment and subsequently classify the text
responses into quantifiable traits using a Zero-shot classifier. Our
classification sheds light on an important anthropomorphic element found in
such AI models and can help stakeholders decide how they should be applied and
how society could perceive them. We augment our analysis by studying approaches
that can alter these personalities.
