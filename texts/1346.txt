Contrastive learning is commonly used as a method of self-supervised learning
with the "anchor" and "positive" being two random augmentations of a given
input image, and the "negative" is the set of all other images. However, the
requirement of large batch sizes and memory banks has made it difficult and
slow to train. This has motivated the rise of Supervised Contrasative
approaches that overcome these problems by using annotated data. We look to
further improve supervised contrastive learning by ranking classes based on
their similarity, and observe the impact of human bias (in the form of ranking)
on the learned representations. We feel this is an important question to
address, as learning good feature embeddings has been a long sought after
problem in computer vision.
