Argumentation Mining addresses the challenging tasks of identifying
boundaries of argumentative text fragments and extracting their relationships.
Fully automated solutions do not reach satisfactory accuracy due to their
insufficient incorporation of semantics and domain knowledge. Therefore,
experts currently rely on time-consuming manual annotations. In this paper, we
present a visual analytics system that augments the manual annotation process
by automatically suggesting which text fragments to annotate next. The accuracy
of those suggestions is improved over time by incorporating linguistic
knowledge and language modeling to learn a measure of argument similarity from
user interactions. Based on a long-term collaboration with domain experts, we
identify and model five high-level analysis tasks. We enable close reading and
note-taking, annotation of arguments, argument reconstruction, extraction of
argument relations, and exploration of argument graphs. To avoid context
switches, we transition between all views through seamless morphing, visually
anchoring all text- and graph-based layers. We evaluate our system with a
two-stage expert user study based on a corpus of presidential debates. The
results show that experts prefer our system over existing solutions due to the
speedup provided by the automatic suggestions and the tight integration between
text and graph views.
