In this paper we present an augmented version of the Abelian scalar clockwork
model to generate geometrically suppressed vacuum expectation values (vev) of
the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons, that we call the clockworked vevs. We
briefly comment on generalization of the setup and possible 5D UV realizations.
We demonstrate how tiny neutrino mass can be generated by clockworking a weak
scale vev.
