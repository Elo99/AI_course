In recent years, many data augmentation techniques have been proposed to
increase the diversity of input data and reduce the risk of overfitting on deep
neural networks. In this work, we propose an easy-to-implement and model-free
data augmentation method called Local Magnification (LOMA). Different from
other geometric data augmentation methods that perform global transformations
on images, LOMA generates additional training data by randomly magnifying a
local area of the image. This local magnification results in geometric changes
that significantly broaden the range of augmentations while maintaining the
recognizability of objects. Moreover, we extend the idea of LOMA and random
cropping to the feature space to augment the feature map, which further boosts
the classification accuracy considerably. Experiments show that our proposed
LOMA, though straightforward, can be combined with standard data augmentation
to significantly improve the performance on image classification and object
detection. And further combination with our feature augmentation techniques,
termed LOMA_IF&FO, can continue to strengthen the model and outperform advanced
intensity transformation methods for data augmentation.
