In this paper, we show that two flat fully augmented links with homeomorphic
complements must be equivalent as links in $\mathbb{S}^{3}$. This requires a
careful analysis of how totally geodesic surfaces and cusps intersect in these
link complements and behave under homeomorphism. One consequence of this
analysis is a complete classification of flat fully augmented link complements
that admit multiple reflection surfaces. In addition, our work classifies those
symmetries of flat fully augmented link complements which are not induced by
symmetries of the corresponding link.
