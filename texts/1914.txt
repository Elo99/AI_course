In order to reduce overfitting, neural networks are typically trained with
data augmentation, the practice of artificially generating additional training
data via label-preserving transformations of existing training examples. While
these types of transformations make intuitive sense, recent work has
demonstrated that even non-label-preserving data augmentation can be
surprisingly effective, examining this type of data augmentation through linear
combinations of pairs of examples. Despite their effectiveness, little is known
about why such methods work. In this work, we aim to explore a new, more
generalized form of this type of data augmentation in order to determine
whether such linearity is necessary. By considering this broader scope of
"mixed-example data augmentation", we find a much larger space of practical
augmentation techniques, including methods that improve upon previous
state-of-the-art. This generalization has benefits beyond the promise of
improved performance, revealing a number of types of mixed-example data
augmentation that are radically different from those considered in prior work,
which provides evidence that current theories for the effectiveness of such
methods are incomplete and suggests that any such theory must explain a much
broader phenomenon. Code is available at
