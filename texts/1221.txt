In this work, we address the issue of a virtual representation of objects of
cultural heritage for haptic interaction. Our main focus is to provide haptic
access to artistic objects of any physical scale to the differently-abled
people. This is a low-cost system and, in conjunction with a stereoscopic
visual display, gives a better immersive experience even to the sighted
persons. To achieve this, we propose a simple multilevel, proxy-based
hapto-visual rendering technique for point cloud data, which includes the
much-desired scalability feature which enables the users to change the scale of
the objects adaptively during the haptic interaction. For the proposed haptic
rendering technique, the proxy updation loop runs at a rate 100 times faster
than the required haptic updation frequency of 1KHz. We observe that this
functionality augments very well with the realism of the experience.
