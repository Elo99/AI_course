We demonstrate that the spin state of solid-state emitters inside micropillar
cavities can serve as measure qubits in syndrome measurements. The photons,
acting as data qubits, interact with the spin state in the microcavity and the
total state of the system evolves conditionally due to the resulting circular
birefringence. By performing a quantum non-demolition measurement on the spin
state, the syndrome of the optical state can be obtained. Furthermore, due to
the symmetry of the interaction, we can alternatively choose to employ the
optical states as measure qubits. This protocol can be adapted to various
resource requirements, including spectral discrepancies between the data qubits
and codes with modified connectivities, by considering entangled measure
qubits. Finally, we show that spin-systems with dissimilar characteristic
energies can still be entangled with high levels of fidelity and tolerance to
cavity losses in the strong coupling regime.
