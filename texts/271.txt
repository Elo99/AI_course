Clinical Text Notes (CTNs) contain physicians' reasoning process, written in
an unstructured free text format, as they examine and interview patients. In
recent years, several studies have been published that provide evidence for the
utility of machine learning for predicting doctors' diagnoses from CTNs, a task
known as ICD coding. Data annotation is time consuming, particularly when a
degree of specialization is needed, as is the case for medical data. This paper
presents a method of augmenting a sparsely annotated dataset of Icelandic CTNs
with a machine-learned imputation in a semi-self-supervised manner. We train a
neural network on a small set of annotated CTNs and use it to extract clinical
features from a set of un-annotated CTNs. These clinical features consist of
answers to about a thousand potential questions that a physician might find the
answers to during a consultation of a patient. The features are then used to
train a classifier for the diagnosis of certain types of diseases. We report
the results of an evaluation of this data augmentation method over three tiers
of data availability to the physician. Our data augmentation method shows a
significant positive effect which is diminished when clinical features from the
examination of the patient and diagnostics are made available. We recommend our
method for augmenting scarce datasets for systems that take decisions based on
clinical features that do not include examinations or tests.
