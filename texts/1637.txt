Emails are one of the most frequently used medium of communication in the
present day across multiple domains including industry and educational
institutions. Understanding sentiments being expressed in an email could have a
considerable impact on the recipients' action or response to the email.
However, it is difficult to interpret emotions of the sender from pure text in
which emotions are not explicitly present. Researchers have tried to predict
customer attrition by integrating emails in client-company environment with
emotions. However, most of the existing works deal with static assessment of
email emotions. Presenting sentiments of emails dynamically to the reader could
help in understanding senders' emotion and as well have an impact on readers'
action. Hence, in this paper, we present EmoG as a Google Chrome Extension
which is intended to support university students. It augments emails with
emojis based on the sentiment being conveyed in the email, which might also
offer faster overview of email sentiments and act as tags that could help in
automatic sorting and processing of emails. Currently, EmoG has been developed
to support Gmail inbox on a Google Chrome browser, and could be extended to
other inboxes and browsers with ease. We have conducted a user survey with 15
university students to understand the usefulness of EmoG and received positive
feedback.
