For training the sequence-to-sequence voice conversion model, we need to
handle an issue of insufficient data about the number of speech pairs which
consist of the same utterance. This study experimentally investigated the
effects of Mel-spectrogram augmentation on training the sequence-to-sequence
voice conversion (VC) model from scratch. For Mel-spectrogram augmentation, we
adopted the policies proposed in SpecAugment. In addition, we proposed new
policies (i.e., frequency warping, loudness and time length control) for more
data variations. Moreover, to find the appropriate hyperparameters of
augmentation policies without training the VC model, we proposed hyperparameter
search strategy and the new metric for reducing experimental cost, namely
deformation per deteriorating ratio. We compared the effect of these
Mel-spectrogram augmentation methods based on various sizes of training set and
augmentation policies. In the experimental results, the time axis warping based
policies (i.e., time length control and time warping.) showed better
performance than other policies. These results indicate that the use of the
Mel-spectrogram augmentation is more beneficial for training the VC model.
