We present here an efficient method which systematically reduces the rank of
the augmented space and thereby helps to implement augmented space recursion
for any real calculation. Our method is based on the symmetry of the
Hamiltonian in the augmented space and keeping recursion basis vectors in the
irreducible subspace of the Hilbert space.
