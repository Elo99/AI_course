The habilitation thesis presents two main directions:
  1. Exploiting data from social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, etc.) -
creating resources for text and image processing (classification, retrieval,
credibility, diversification, etc.);
  2. Creating applications with new technologies : augmented reality
(eLearning, games, smart museums, gastronomy, etc.), virtual reality (eLearning
and games), speech processing with Amazon Alexa (eLearning, entertainment, IoT,
etc.).
  The work was validated with good results in evaluation campaigns like CLEF
(Question Answering, Image CLEF, LifeCLEF, etc.), SemEval (Sentiment and
Emotion in text, Anorexia, etc.).
