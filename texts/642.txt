Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is a practical means of
communication for people with language disabilities. In this study, we propose
PicTalky, which is an AI-based AAC system that helps children with language
developmental disabilities to improve their communication skills and language
comprehension abilities. PicTalky can process both text and pictograms more
accurately by connecting a series of neural-based NLP modules. Moreover, we
perform quantitative and qualitative analyses on the essential features of
PicTalky. It is expected that those suffering from language problems will be
able to express their intentions or desires more easily and improve their
quality of life by using this service. We have made the models freely available
alongside a demonstration of the Web interface. Furthermore, we implemented
robotics AAC for the first time by applying PicTalky to the NAO robot.
