To interpret the genetic profile present in a patient sample, it is necessary
to know which mutations have important roles in the development of the
corresponding cancer type. Named entity recognition is a core step in the text
mining pipeline which facilitates mining valuable cancer information from the
scientific literature. However, due to the scarcity of related datasets,
previous NER attempts in this domain either suffer from low performance when
deep learning based models are deployed, or they apply feature based machine
learning models or rule based models to tackle this problem, which requires
intensive efforts from domain experts, and limit the model generalization
capability. In this paper, we propose EPICURE, an ensemble pre trained model
equipped with a conditional random field pattern layer and a span prediction
pattern layer to extract cancer mutations from text. We also adopt a data
augmentation strategy to expand our training set from multiple datasets.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show competitive results
compared to the baseline models.
