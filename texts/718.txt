We address the problem of cross-speaker style transfer for text-to-speech
(TTS) using data augmentation via voice conversion. We assume to have a corpus
of neutral non-expressive data from a target speaker and supporting
conversational expressive data from different speakers. Our goal is to build a
TTS system that is expressive, while retaining the target speaker's identity.
The proposed approach relies on voice conversion to first generate high-quality
data from the set of supporting expressive speakers. The voice converted data
is then pooled with natural data from the target speaker and used to train a
single-speaker multi-style TTS system. We provide evidence that this approach
is efficient, flexible, and scalable. The method is evaluated using one or more
supporting speakers, as well as a variable amount of supporting data. We
further provide evidence that this approach allows some controllability of
speaking style, when using multiple supporting speakers. We conclude by scaling
our proposed technology to a set of 14 speakers across 7 languages. Results
indicate that our technology consistently improves synthetic samples in terms
of style similarity, while retaining the target speaker's identity.
