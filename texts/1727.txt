Due to the ubiquity of mobile phones and location-detection devices, location
data is being generated in very large volumes. Queries and operations that are
performed on location data warrant the use of database systems. Despite that,
location data is being supported in data systems as an afterthought. Typically,
relational or NoSQL data systems that are mostly designed with non-location
data in mind get extended with spatial or spatiotemporal indexes, some query
operators, and higher level syntactic sugar in order to support location data.
The ubiquity of location data and location data services call for systems that
are solely designed and optimized for the efficient support of location data.
This paper envisions designing intelligent location+X data systems, ILX for
short, where location is treated as a first-class citizen type. ILX is tailored
with location data as the main data type (location-first). Because location
data is typically augmented with other data types X, e.g., graphs, text data,
click streams, annotations, etc., ILX needs to be extensible to support other
data types X along with location. This paper envisions the main features that
ILX should support, and highlights research challenges in realizing and
supporting ILX.
