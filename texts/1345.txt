With the broad reach of the internet and smartphones, e-commerce platforms
have an increasingly diversified user base. Since native language users are not
conversant in English, their preferred browsing mode is their regional language
or a combination of their regional language and English. From our recent study
on the query data, we noticed that many of the queries we receive are code-mix,
specifically Hinglish i.e. queries with one or more Hindi words written in
English (Latin) script. We propose a transformer-based approach for code-mix
query translation to enable users to search with these queries. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of pre-trained encoder-decoder models trained on a large
corpus of the unlabeled English text for this task. Using generic domain
translation models, we created a pseudo-labelled dataset for training the model
on the search queries and verified the effectiveness of various data
augmentation techniques. Further, to reduce the latency of the model, we use
knowledge distillation and weight quantization. Effectiveness of the proposed
method has been validated through experimental evaluations and A/B testing. The
model is currently live on Flipkart app and website, serving millions of
queries.
