While contrastive learning greatly advances the representation of sentence
embeddings, it is still limited by the size of the existing sentence datasets.
In this paper, we present TransAug (Translate as Augmentation), which provide
the first exploration of utilizing translated sentence pairs as data
augmentation for text, and introduce a two-stage paradigm to advances the
state-of-the-art sentence embeddings. Instead of adopting an encoder trained in
other languages setting, we first distill a Chinese encoder from a SimCSE
encoder (pretrained in English), so that their embeddings are close in semantic
space, which can be regraded as implicit data augmentation. Then, we only
update the English encoder via cross-lingual contrastive learning and frozen
the distilled Chinese encoder. Our approach achieves a new state-of-art on
standard semantic textual similarity (STS), outperforming both SimCSE and
Sentence-T5, and the best performance in corresponding tracks on transfer tasks
evaluated by SentEval.
