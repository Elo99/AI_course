Audio data augmentation is a key step in training deep neural networks for
solving audio classification tasks. In this paper, we introduce Audiogmenter, a
novel audio data augmentation library in MATLAB. We provide 15 different
augmentation algorithms for raw audio data and 8 for spectrograms. We
efficiently implemented several augmentation techniques whose usefulness has
been extensively proved in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the largest MATLAB audio data augmentation library freely available. We
validate the efficiency of our algorithms evaluating them on the ESC-50
dataset. The toolbox and its documentation can be downloaded at
