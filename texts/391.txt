In this paper, we focus on video-to-text summarization and investigate how to
best utilize multimodal information for summarizing long inputs (e.g., an
hour-long TV show) into long outputs (e.g., a multi-sentence summary). We
extend SummScreen (Chen et al., 2021), a dialogue summarization dataset
consisting of transcripts of TV episodes with reference summaries, and create a
multimodal variant by collecting corresponding full-length videos. We
incorporate multimodal information into a pre-trained textual summarizer
efficiently using adapter modules augmented with a hierarchical structure while
tuning only 3.8\% of model parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that
multimodal information offers superior performance over more memory-heavy and
fully fine-tuned textual summarization methods.
