Deep Neural Networks have taken Natural Language Processing by storm. While
this led to incredible improvements across many tasks, it also initiated a new
research field, questioning the robustness of these neural networks by
attacking them. In this paper, we investigate four word substitution-based
attacks on BERT. We combine a human evaluation of individual word substitutions
and a probabilistic analysis to show that between 96% and 99% of the analyzed
attacks do not preserve semantics, indicating that their success is mainly
based on feeding poor data to the model. To further confirm that, we introduce
an efficient data augmentation procedure and show that many adversarial
examples can be prevented by including data similar to the attacks during
training. An additional post-processing step reduces the success rates of
state-of-the-art attacks below 5%. Finally, by looking at more reasonable
thresholds on constraints for word substitutions, we conclude that BERT is a
lot more robust than research on attacks suggests.
