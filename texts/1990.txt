Voice conversion (VC) could be used to improve speech recognition systems in
low-resource languages by using it to augment limited training data. However,
VC has not been widely used for this purpose because of practical issues such
as compute speed and limitations when converting to and from unseen speakers.
Moreover, it is still unclear whether a VC model trained on one well-resourced
language can be applied to speech from another low-resource language for the
aim of data augmentation. In this work we assess whether a VC system can be
used cross-lingually to improve low-resource speech recognition. We combine
several recent techniques to design and train a practical VC system in English,
and then use this system to augment data for training speech recognition models
in several low-resource languages. When using a sensible amount of VC augmented
data, speech recognition performance is improved in all four low-resource
languages considered. We also show that VC-based augmentation is superior to
SpecAugment (a widely used signal processing augmentation method) in the
low-resource languages considered.
