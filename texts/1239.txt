Discrete abstractions have become a standard approach to assist control
synthesis under complex specifications. Most techniques for the construction of
a discrete abstraction for a continuous-time system require time-space
discretization of the concrete system, which constitutes property satisfaction
for the continuous-time system non-trivial. In this work, we aim at relaxing
this requirement by introducing a control interface. Firstly, we connect the
continuous-time uncertain concrete system with its discrete deterministic
state-space abstraction with a control interface. Then, a novel stability
notion called $\eta$-approximate controlled globally practically stable, and a
new simulation relation called robust approximate simulation relation are
proposed. It is shown that the uncertain concrete system, under the condition
that there exists an admissible control interface such that the augmented
system (composed of the concrete system and its abstraction) can be made
$\eta$-approximate controlled globally practically stable, robustly
approximately simulates its discrete abstraction. The effectiveness of the
proposed results is illustrated by two simulation examples.
