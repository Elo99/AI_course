Dialect differences caused by regional, social, and economic barriers cause
performance discrepancies for many groups of users of language technology.
Fair, inclusive, and equitable language technology must critically be dialect
invariant, meaning that performance remains constant over dialectal shifts.
Current English systems often fall significantly short of this ideal since they
are designed and tested on a single dialect: Standard American English. We
introduce Multi-VALUE -- a suite of resources for evaluating and achieving
English dialect invariance. We build a controllable rule-based translation
system spanning 50 English dialects and a total of 189 unique linguistic
features. Our translation maps Standard American English text to synthetic form
of each dialect, which uses an upper-bound on the natural density of features
in that dialect. First, we use this system to build stress tests for question
answering, machine translation, and semantic parsing tasks. Stress tests reveal
significant performance disparities for leading models on non-standard
dialects. Second, we use this system as a data augmentation technique to
improve the dialect robustness of existing systems. Finally, we partner with
native speakers of Chicano and Indian English to release new gold-standard
variants of the popular CoQA task.
