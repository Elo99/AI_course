Neural Networks (NNs) have been widely {used in supervised learning} due to
their ability to model complex nonlinear patterns, often presented in
high-dimensional data such as images and text. However, traditional NNs often
lack the ability for uncertainty quantification. Bayesian NNs (BNNS) could help
measure the uncertainty by considering the distributions of the NN model
parameters. Besides, domain knowledge is commonly available and could improve
the performance of BNNs if it can be appropriately incorporated. In this work,
we propose a novel Posterior-Regularized Bayesian Neural Network (PR-BNN) model
by incorporating different types of knowledge constraints, such as the soft and
hard constraints, as a posterior regularization term. Furthermore, we propose
to combine the augmented Lagrangian method and the existing BNN solvers for
efficient inference. The experiments in simulation and two case studies about
aviation landing prediction and solar energy output prediction have shown the
knowledge constraints and the performance improvement of the proposed model
over traditional BNNs without the constraints.
