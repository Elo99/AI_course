The aim of this work is to thoroughly investigate Buchi automata augmented
with spatial constraints. The input trees of such an automaton are infinite
k-ary Sigma-trees, with the nodes standing for time points, and Sigma
including, additionally to its uses in classical k-ary Sigma-trees, the
description of the snapshot of an n-object spatial scene of interest. The
constraints, from an RCC8-like spatial Relation Algebra (RA) x, are used to
impose spatial constraints on objects of the spatial scene, eventually at
different nodes of the input trees. We show that a Buchi alternating automaton
augmented with spatial constraints can be simulated with a classical Buchi
nondeterministic automaton of the same type, augmented with spatial
constraints. We then provide a nondeterministic doubly depth-first polynomial
space algorithm for the emptiness problem of the latter automaton. Our main
motivation came from another work, also submitted to this conference, which
defines a spatio-temporalisation of the well-known family ALC(D) of description
logics with a concrete domain: together, the two works provide an effective
solution to the satisfiability problem of a concept of the
spatio-temporalisation with respect to a weakly cyclic TBox.
