Switching between different levels of resolution is essential for multiscale
modeling, but restoring details at higher resolution remains challenging. In
our previous study we have introduced deepBackmap: a deep neural-network-based
approach to reverse-map equilibrated molecular structures for condensed-phase
systems. Our method combines data-driven and physics-based aspects, leading to
high-quality reconstructed structures. In this work, we expand the scope of our
model and examine its chemical transferability. To this end, we train
deepBackmap solely on homogeneous molecular liquids of small molecules, and
apply it to a more challenging polymer melt. We augment the generator's
objective with different force-field-based terms as prior to regularize the
results. The best performing physical prior depends on whether we train for a
specific chemistry, or transfer our model. Our local environment representation
combined with the sequential reconstruction of fine-grained structures help
reach transferability of the learned correlations.
