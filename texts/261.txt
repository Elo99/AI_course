A multiple conjugation quandle is an algebra whose axioms are motivated from
handlebody-knot theory. Any linear extension of a multiple conjugation quandle
can be described by using a pair of maps called an MCQ Alexander pair. In this
paper, we show that any affine extension of a multiple conjugation quandle can
be described by using a quadruple of maps, called an augmented MCQ Alexander
pair.
