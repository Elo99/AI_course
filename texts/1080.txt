The recent advances in Natural Language Processing have been a boon for
well-represented languages in terms of available curated data and research
resources. One of the challenges for low-resourced languages is clear
guidelines on the collection, curation and preparation of datasets for
different use-cases. In this work, we take on the task of creation of two
datasets that are focused on news headlines (i.e short text) for Setswana and
Sepedi and creation of a news topic classification task. We document our work
and also present baselines for classification. We investigate an approach on
data augmentation, better suited to low resource languages, to improve the
performance of the classifiers
