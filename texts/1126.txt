We study authomorphisms of $Ind$-groups of polynomial automorphisms (wich are
singular) via tame approximations. Such objects were pioneeered in research by
B.I.Plotkin
  We obtain a number of properties of $Aut(Aut(A))$, where $A$ is the
polynomial or free associative algebra over the base field $K$. We prove that
all $Ind$-scheme automorphisms of $Aut(K[x_1,\dots,x_n])$ are inner for $n\ge
3$, and all $Ind$-scheme automorphisms of $Aut(K\langle x_1,\dots, x_n\rangle)$
are semi-inner.
  As an application, we prove that $Aut(K[x_1,\dots,x_n])$ cannot be embedded
into $Aut(K\langle x_1,\dots,x_n\rangle)$ by the natural abelianization. In
other words, the {\it Automorphism Group Lifting Problem} has a negative
solution. We explore close connection between the above results and the
Jacobian conjecture type questions, formulate the Jacobian conjecture for
fields of any characteristic.
