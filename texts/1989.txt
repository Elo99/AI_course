For knowledge graph completion, two major types of prediction models exist:
one based on graph embeddings, and the other based on relation path rule
induction. They have different advantages and disadvantages. To take advantage
of both types, hybrid models have been proposed recently. One of the hybrid
models, UniKER, alternately augments training data by relation path rules and
trains an embedding model. Despite its high prediction accuracy, it does not
take full advantage of relation path rules, as it disregards low-confidence
rules in order to maintain the quality of augmented data. To mitigate this
limitation, we propose transductive data augmentation by relation path rules
and confidence-based weighting of augmented data. The results and analysis show
that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of the embedding
model by augmenting data that include true answers or entities similar to them.
