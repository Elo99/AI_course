Data augmentation (DA) has been widely investigated to facilitate model
optimization in many tasks. However, in most cases, data augmentation is
randomly performed for each training sample with a certain probability, which
might incur content destruction and visual ambiguities. To eliminate this, in
this paper, we propose an effective approach, dubbed SelectAugment, to select
samples to be augmented in a deterministic and online manner based on the
sample contents and the network training status. Specifically, in each batch,
we first determine the augmentation ratio, and then decide whether to augment
each training sample under this ratio. We model this process as a two-step
Markov decision process and adopt Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to
learn the augmentation policy. In this way, the negative effects of the
randomness in selecting samples to augment can be effectively alleviated and
the effectiveness of DA is improved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed SelectAugment can be adapted upon numerous commonly used DA methods,
e.g., Mixup, Cutmix, AutoAugment, etc, and improve their performance on
multiple benchmark datasets of image classification and fine-grained image
recognition.
