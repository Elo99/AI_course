Nowadays document analysis and recognition remain challenging tasks. However,
only a few datasets designed for text detection (TD) and optical character
recognition (OCR) problems exist. In this paper we present Distorted Document
Images dataset (DDI-100) and demonstrate its usefulness in a wide range of
document analysis problems. DDI-100 dataset is a synthetic dataset based on
7000 real unique document pages and consists of more than 100000 augmented
images. Ground truth comprises text and stamp masks, text and characters
bounding boxes with relevant annotations. Validation of DDI-100 dataset was
conducted using several TD and OCR models that show high-quality performance on
real data.
