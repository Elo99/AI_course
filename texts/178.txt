Advanced neural network models have penetrated Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) in recent years, however, in language modeling many systems still rely on
traditional Back-off N-gram Language Models (BNLM) partly or entirely. The
reason for this are the high cost and complexity of training and using neural
language models, mostly possible by adding a second decoding pass (rescoring).
In our recent work we have significantly improved the online performance of a
conversational speech transcription system by transferring knowledge from a
Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNNLM) to the single pass BNLM with
text generation based data augmentation. In the present paper we analyze the
amount of transferable knowledge and demonstrate that the neural augmented LM
(RNN-BNLM) can help to capture almost 50% of the knowledge of the RNNLM yet by
dropping the second decoding pass and making the system real-time capable. We
also systematically compare word and subword LMs and show that subword-based
neural text augmentation can be especially beneficial in under-resourced
conditions. In addition, we show that using the RNN-BNLM in the first pass
followed by a neural second pass, offline ASR results can be even significantly
improved.
