The recently developed pitch-controllable text-to-speech (TTS) model, i.e.
FastPitch, was conditioned for the pitch contours. However, the quality of the
synthesized speech degraded considerably for pitch values that deviated
significantly from the average pitch; i.e. the ability to control pitch was
limited. To address this issue, we propose two algorithms to improve the
robustness of FastPitch. First, we propose a novel timbre-preserving
pitch-shifting algorithm for natural pitch augmentation. Pitch-shifted speech
samples sound more natural when using the proposed algorithm because the
speaker's vocal timbre is maintained. Moreover, we propose a training algorithm
that defines FastPitch using pitch-augmented speech datasets with different
pitch ranges for the same sentence. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithms improve the pitch controllability of FastPitch.
