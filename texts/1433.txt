We study the relation between augmentations and sheaves in the context of
framed oriented links. In this set up, we find slightly more sheaves than
augmentations. After removing the sporadic sheaves, we construct a bijective
correspondence between augmentations of the framed cord algebra and simple
sheaves that are micro-supported along the conormal bundle of the link.
