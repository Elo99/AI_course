Internet of Things (IoT) technology has delivered new enablers for improving
human abilities. These enablers promise an enhanced quality of life and
professional efficiency; however, the synthesis of IoT and human augmentation
technologies has also extended IoT-related challenges far beyond the current
scope. These potential challenges associated with IoT-empowered Augmented Human
(AH) have so far not been well-investigated. Thus, this article attempts to
introduce readers to AH concept as well as summarize notable research
challenges raised by such systems, in order to facilitate reader's further
interest in this topic. The article considers emerging IoT applications for
human augmentation, devices and design principles, connectivity demands, and
security aspects.
