We demonstrate a novel method for nanowire formation by natural selection
during wet chemical etching in boiling Phosphoric acid. It is observed that
wire lateral dimensions of sub-10 nm and lengths of 700 nm or more have been
naturally formed during the wet etching. The dimension variation is controlled
through etching times wherein the underlying cause is the merging of the nearby
crystallographic hexagonal etch pits. The emission processes involving excitons
are found to be efficient and lead to enhanced emission characteristics. The
exciton binding energy is augmented by using quantum confinement whereby
enforcing greater overlap of the electron-hole wave-function. The surviving
nanowires are nearly defect-free, have large exciton binding energies of around
45 meV and a small temperature variation of the output electroluminescent
light. We have observed superluminescent behaviour of the LEDs formed on these
nanowires. There is no observable efficiency roll off till current densities of
400 A/cm2. The present work thus provides an innovative and cost effective
manner of device fabrication on the formed nanowires and proves the immediate
performance enhancement achievable.
