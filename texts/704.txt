This report, commissioned by the WTW research network, investigates the use
of AI in property risk assessment. It (i) reviews existing work on risk
assessment in commercial and industrial properties and automated information
extraction from building blueprints; and (ii) presents an exploratory 'proof-of
concept-solution' exploring the feasibility of using machine learning for the
automated extraction of information from building blueprints to support
insurance risk assessment.
