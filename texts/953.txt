We develop the framework for augmented homotopical algebraic geometry. This
is an extension of homotopical algebraic geometry, which itself is a
homotopification of classical algebraic geometry. To do so, we define the
notion of augmentation categories, which are a special class of generalised
Reedy categories. For an augmentation category, we prove the existence of a
closed Quillen model structure on the presheaf category which is compatible
with the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets. Moreover, we use the
concept of augmented hypercovers to define a local model structure on the
category of augmented presheaves. We prove that crossed simplicial groups, and
the planar rooted tree category are examples of augmentation categories.
Finally, we introduce a method for generating new examples from old via a
categorical pushout construction.
