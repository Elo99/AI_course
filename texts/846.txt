The state-of-the-art language model-based automatic metrics, e.g. BARTScore,
benefiting from large-scale contextualized pre-training, have been successfully
used in a wide range of natural language generation (NLG) tasks, including
machine translation, text summarization, and data-to-text. Recent studies show
that considering both major errors (e.g. mistranslated tokens) and minor errors
(e.g. imperfections in fluency) can produce high-quality human judgments. This
inspires us to approach the final goal of the evaluation metrics (human-like
evaluations) by automatic error analysis. To this end, we augment BARTScore by
incorporating the human-like error analysis strategies, namely BARTScore++,
where the final score consists of both the evaluations of major errors and
minor errors. Experimental results show that BARTScore++ can consistently
improve the performance of vanilla BARTScore and outperform existing
top-scoring metrics in 20 out of 25 test settings. We hope our technique can
also be extended to other pre-trained model-based metrics. We will release our
code and scripts to facilitate the community.
