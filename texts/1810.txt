When establishing a visual connection between a virtual reality user and an
augmented reality user, it is important to consider whether the augmented
reality user faces a surplus of information. Augmented reality, compared to
virtual reality, involves two, not one, planes of information: the physical and
the virtual. We propose SelectVisAR, a selective visualisation system of
virtual environments in augmented reality. Our system enables an augmented
reality spectator to perceive a co-located virtual reality user in the context
of four distinct visualisation conditions: Interactive, Proximity, Everything,
and Dollhouse. We explore an additional two conditions, Context and Spotlight,
in a follow-up study. Our design uses a human-centric approach to information
filtering, selectively visualising only parts of the virtual environment
related to the interactive possibilities of a virtual reality user. The
research investigates how selective visualisations can be helpful or trivial
for the augmented reality user when observing a virtual reality user.
