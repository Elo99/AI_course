Using augmented reality in education is already a common concept, as it has
the potential to turn learning into a motivational learning experience.
However, current research only covers the students site of learning. Almost no
research focuses on the teachers' site and whether augmented reality could
potentially improve his/her workflow of teaching the students or not. Many
researchers do not differentiate between multiple user roles, like a student
and a teacher. To allow investigation into these lacks of research, a teaching
system "Augmentix" is presented, which includes a differentiation between the
two user roles "teacher" and "student" to potentially enhances the teachers
workflow by using augmented reality. In this system's setting the student can
explore a virtual city in virtual reality and the teacher can guide him with
augmented reality.
