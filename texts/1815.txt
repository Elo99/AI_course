Data augmentation is a commonly used approach to improving the generalization
of deep learning models. Recent works show that learned data augmentation
policies can achieve better generalization than hand-crafted ones. However,
most of these works use unified augmentation policies for all samples in a
dataset, which is observed not necessarily beneficial for all labels in
multi-label classification tasks, i.e., some policies may have negative impacts
on some labels while benefitting the others. To tackle this problem, we propose
a novel Label-Based AutoAugmentation (LB-Aug) method for multi-label scenarios,
where augmentation policies are generated with respect to labels by an
augmentation-policy network. The policies are learned via reinforcement
learning using policy gradient methods, providing a mapping from instance
labels to their optimal augmentation policies. Numerical experiments show that
our LB-Aug outperforms previous state-of-the-art augmentation methods by large
margins in multiple benchmarks on image and video classification.
