One of the biggest problems in neural learning networks is the lack of
training data available to train the network. Data augmentation techniques over
the past few years, have therefore been developed, aiming to increase the
amount of artificial training data with the limited number of real world
samples. In this paper, we look particularly at the MNIST handwritten dataset
an image dataset used for digit recognition, and the methods of data
augmentation done on this data set. We then take a detailed look into one of
the most popular augmentation techniques used for this data set elastic
deformation; and highlight its demerit of degradation in the quality of data,
which introduces irrelevant data to the training set. To decrease this
irrelevancy, we propose to use a similarity measure called Complex Wavelet
Structural Similarity Index Measure (CWSSIM) to selectively filter out the
irrelevant data before we augment the data set. We compare our observations
with the existing augmentation technique and find our proposed method works
yields better results than the existing technique.
