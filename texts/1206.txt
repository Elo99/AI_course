Making quantum mechanical equations and concepts come to life through
interactive simulation and visualization are commonplace for augmenting
learning and teaching. However, graphical visualizations nearly always exhibit
a set of hard-coded functionalities while corresponding text-based codes offer
a higher degree of flexibility at the expense of steep learning curves or time
investments. We introduce Quantum Composer, which allows the user to build,
expand, or explore quantum mechanical simulations by interacting with
graphically connectable nodes, each corresponding to a physical concept,
mathematical operation, visualization, etc. Abstracting away numerical and
programming details while at the same time retaining accessibility, emphasis on
understanding, and rapid feedback mechanisms, we illustrate through a series of
examples its open-ended applicability in both introductory and advanced quantum
mechanics courses, student projects, and for visual exploration within research
environments.
