Devising augmentations for graph contrastive learning is challenging due to
their irregular structure, drastic distribution shifts, and nonequivalent
feature spaces across datasets. We introduce LG2AR, Learning Graph
Augmentations to Learn Graph Representations, which is an end-to-end automatic
graph augmentation framework that helps encoders learn generalizable
representations on both node and graph levels. LG2AR consists of a
probabilistic policy that learns a distribution over augmentations and a set of
probabilistic augmentation heads that learn distributions over augmentation
parameters. We show that LG2AR achieves state-of-the-art results on 18 out of
20 graph-level and node-level benchmarks compared to previous unsupervised
models under both linear and semi-supervised evaluation protocols. The source
code will be released here: https://github.com/kavehhassani/lg2ar
