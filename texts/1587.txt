When traveling to a foreign country, we are often in dire need of an
intelligent conversational agent to provide instant and informative responses
to our various queries. However, to build such a travel agent is non-trivial.
First of all, travel naturally involves several sub-tasks such as hotel
reservation, restaurant recommendation and taxi booking etc, which invokes the
need for global topic control. Secondly, the agent should consider various
constraints like price or distance given by the user to recommend an
appropriate venue. In this paper, we present a Deep Conversational Recommender
(DCR) and apply to travel. It augments the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)
models with a neural latent topic component to better guide response generation
and make the training easier. To consider the various constraints for venue
recommendation, we leverage a graph convolutional network (GCN) based approach
to capture the relationships between different venues and the match between
venue and dialog context. For response generation, we combine the topic-based
component with the idea of pointer networks, which allows us to effectively
incorporate recommendation results. We perform extensive evaluation on a
multi-turn task-oriented dialog dataset in travel domain and the results show
that our method achieves superior performance as compared to a wide range of
baselines.
